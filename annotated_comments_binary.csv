"Just plain bad. The premise is unique, so terrible trying to be ""not like the other games"". No ads, so of course it's awful because I can't watch my precious ads. It provides a challenge, which is completely heinous because I need everything handed to me. One good thing about it though is that there's no way to get back to the menu when you play. But that doesn't take away from the absolute awfulness of this game. DO NOT PLAY!!!",Yes,Irony
"I barely write reviews, but I had to on this one because it was absolutely AWFUL. There are no ads which is absolutely terrible I like my games all ad and no game. The gameplay is absolutely terrible, it's easy to get and very fun. The menu is easy to navigate which is uncalled for and extremely frustrating. If I could I would rate it 0 stars.",Yes,Irony
"It was a mess. My eyes hurt after playing the game because eye-straining colors with poor interface. It is not enjoyable to begin, it greatly lacks in background design and does not even have an effects. It did not even have an instruction or gameplay leaving me clueless on how the game works. Overall, it was a total eyesore. But I am sure that it will improve just a bit more motivation to plan.",Yes,Humor
"The game itself isn't terrable, but extremely repetitive with what you do. Tap on the colour and the word that says the colour on it, but avoid the wrong word on the wrong colour. Simple, to the point, and repetitive with what you do, even without anything to attempt to spice it up a little bit. What you see is what you get, and I got a game that is the equivalent of putting a toothpick under your toenail and kicking a wall. Hell even thats more eventful than this terrable arcade game.",No,None
"I like games with ads, but this one doesn't even have any ad, like no ads whatsoever. I played it and I didn't get an ad, like I need ads what are basically 30 secs long and you can't skip. The gameplay is very hard, even my fish drowned after seeing it. It's hard and no one can beat it. Game devs please add more ads and make us beat the game. (This was a joke, no offense to the devs in any way)",No,None
"Not enough ads. This is driving me insane! Like, you want to make money from this, right? There's no popup ads or forced ads. All there is is some lousy ads at the bottom of the screen. Like get this, they still let you enjoy a full gaming experience while the ads are displayed. Ugh! One star! Terrible!",Yes,Irony
I am disappointed. The game does not have ads. Ads are the whole point of games. They are what stops you in the middle of a game. Ads are enjoyable to watch. Ads are awesome. Another bad thing about this horrible app is its gameplay. It was tremendously hard! I want to win a game instantly. WORST APP EVER! If I could give this trash 0 stars I definitely would.,Yes,Humor
"I would rate this 0 stars if I could! I has no ads! How can I enjoy something if it has no ads! It also has an enjoyable game, which sucks because I like it! I hate liking things! I also hate how it has one of the most creative goals. That doesn't irritate me, which irritates me, because I like being irritated, but not in this scenario! 1 star!!!",Yes,Humor
"As soon as I installed this app, my phone broke in half and is now two separate pieces. The touchscreen and keyboard apparently still work, but the camera doesnt. Thats what Id call cellular division. It also has way too many ads. Very annoying. Oh and also it made my right foot a bit laggy. It's just too bad for existance. Now my shower is also laggy. For some reason, my middle finger is negatively laggy, which means it moves before I actually decide to move it. Some people got mad at me. AAAAA",No,None
"The app is so-so, the gameplay is not that good, and not that bad, it gets harder the longer you play it but it is also very forgiving.The moving boxes sometimes doesn't register the tap or it sometimes register 2 times which is a minor problem given that you can skip the tapping. Giving it a one star because it's what the devs want. Honest review : 1.5 stars, it doesn't stand out and it gets boring very fast(it's addicting tho). It needs a variety of customizations for it to reach 3-4 stars.",No,None
"One star, it was boring and you don't expect much from it, except being the worst game ever. Game needed more features, at least add more mods to keep it interestingly longer. It also needs to change that sound effect when you get a right answer, I felt like I was bar-code scanning items in a grocery store.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Awful, this app is horrible. it didnt have ANY ads, which is basically the point of games. You really have to work and think to get score, which I think ruins all games, as I like things to be handed to me from the start. I don't recomend this app to anyone. I cant believe anyone could even possible make such a bad game.",Yes,Irony
"Horrible, it had no ads! Which is my favorite part of games, I hate not being able to get ads in my face every millisecond! Second, it gave me bad luck, I had to donate my kidney to a dead person because it's so called ""good for them"" 2nd of all, my house burned down because I was drinking water, the water turned into flames after seeing the eye-straining colours. 3rd and last, I never got my chipotle.",No,None
"What I think about this game is that it really needs a lot of improvements especially in the style, gameplay and game design. There are no enjoyable moment within the game. It is so plain and the colors of the shape are eye straining. It could be improved with the design of how the shapes float and with the interactivity of the buttons, maybe a more pleasing style for the eye. It needs more challenges, difficulties, and maybe another level for the players to enioy. And also a pause button.",Yes,Humor
"Game was brilliantly made, not one miserable thought came to mind playing this. As I click on the lovely contrasted blocks of perfection, I couldn't help but feel as if I found the secret to life. This game, no. This paradise of experiences has taught me well. Thank you good sir.",No,None
"The only good thing I can say about this game is that the challenge was enjoyable, otherwise, it was painful. The interface does not help in giving cues on what it is about and uses eye straining colors. There are no instructions. Gameplay-wise it similar it is to rhythm-based games. Flow of incoming blocks vary in speed and difficulty becomes a headache to catch up to. Overall, despite its flaws, it was fun to play. Would recommend to other people to suffer like I did. (this is for school btw)",Yes,Humor
"I HATE THIS GAME!!! I can't watch my ads! Like seriously.. ð© worst game ever. Also, the only thing I love about it is that it calls me a loser!! I love it so much! But there's no way to go back to the main menu... AMAZING but then when you get to it... IYS EDUCATIONAL bleckkk ew nastayy I hate this game so much and please download tho...",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"The game suggested to give itself only a star so I rated it with only one star. The game gmhas potential, it is challenging yet fun. The downside was the design of the title page and ui. The simplicity of the design during the game was alright because it chellanges the player with the similarities of the tile shapes. Overall, it was a fun game to play.",Yes,Humor
"The game is thrilling but gives nausea later on as you keep chasing the blocks with your eyes and at the same time, thinking if you've got the right color. But all in all, this game has potential to improve in many areas. Keep annoying your players while giving fun!",Yes,Humor
"This app is extremely dangerous. I'm not recommend you guys to use this app. At first I thought those reviews are just a joke, but as soon as I open the app, my phone start freezing and just suddenly turn off. When my phone is turning on, the Samsung logo just freeze and the phone slowly overheating. Luckily, I have another phone so I can warn you guys DO NOT OPEN THIS APP. You have been warned!",No,None
It's literally nothing there is a game that u have to click on the blocks. For ex. If there is a red block and it says green in it and u click on it u will lose a live but if there is a red block and it says red in it click on it and it will get u a higher score moving forward. It's honestly really boring. I don't recommend.,No,None
"This game is absolute GARBAGE. I mean, how can I enjoy a game when it has no ads?! And heck, even the game itself is trash. It took me 3 seconds to understand it, that is way to long for my standards. And the fact that it's fun isn't even the worst part. The worst part is the fact that it's unique. How dare the devs make a game with no ads AND make a fun and addictive game! I can't believe I even bothered to install this price of poop.",Yes,Irony
"What is this? You simply have a fun game with no ads. Despicable. These creators are just begging for a one star review with how bad this app is. How am I supposed to enjoy my ads with no ads. The fact that it is fun and somewhat challenging... Disgusting. It even requires me to use my brain. Only a demonic creature bent on mass destruction could have come up with something so awful. I'm going back to play evil sponge neighbor find the secrets. Plenty of ads, ans no thinkinf needed. L + Ratio.",Yes,Irony
This is the worst game in the history of worst games. 1. It has NO ADS can't enjoy anything without ads popping up every 30 seconds. And 2. ITS SO COMPLICATED you tap squares make it easier!!,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Just plain bad. Theres no top-tier ads for me to find new, better games. It's just white with flashing colors, completely pointless. I don't understand who would come up with such a horrible idea for a game. You know what, I hate this game so much, that I'll even tell my grandmother to give this game one star. Absolute trash. If I could give 0 stars, I would.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Awful. 3 columns and colors. I am daltonic, so this game is the worst thing I ever saw. Althrough, I can give it a good rating: they helped me to remind my life situation that I messed up. No ads, but this can be consumed, that is great, that you learned how to hide them. All wrong answers were an Ads. I knew it. ONe S ta R",Yes,Irony
"Worst game ever. The game is engaging, which is bad because i missed a meeting, it insults me when i fail, which reminds me of my ex-wife, Sharon, it lets me ay a GAME (can you belive it? It LETS me play a game?) I was expecting a challenge to get onto the game but nope! Too easy! Oh but the ads are the worst, where are my precious,beautiful,wonderful ads?? Im heartbroken",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"This app is ridiculous! The game is actually challenging, and I can't believe how little there are ads in this! I can't live without my precious ads! This is a horrible app. The only good thing about it is there's not more then one of those terrible games in the app!",Yes,Irony
This game was enjoyable even though i didnt know what to do first or how the game works. Its quite challenging but sometimes the colors are not being tapped and missed it. Add designs to the game and use other colors or change the background that would fit for the game.,Yes,Humor
The game was easy to get. The main menu was easy to navigate. And there are no adds so I can not watch my precious adds. So there for it is bad/good.,No,None
"The reason why the game is called one of the worst is because of the lack of instructions on how the game works. As I played it, I have no idea on what I am doing because the buttons also dont have interaction with the players in clicking it. As I got to play it in my third try, I was able to get the game and got 920 points. It is boring because as you progress, you do not level up and there's no certain effect with getting a high point in the game. The game itself makes no sense.ð",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Worst game ever. They have the audacity to make it a simple and nice enjoyable game I can quickly play while I'm bored. I'm baffled at the thought that they actually don't stop my game to display ads like, I wanna see ads, that's like a big reason I played the game! Unenjoyable. I recommend rating it a 1 star to warn other people",Yes,Humor
"The app deserves its one star rating because the app is not enjoyable and it does not have anything most user/players would be interested in and most importantly, the interface is not friendly. It would've been better if the developer added challenges and rewards or user customization for the players to put effort in playing the game.",Yes,Humor
It was a fun game though it needs improvement. The game does not have an end unless you will tap the wrong rectangle to lose lives. Maybe you can add other features like scoreboard so that the player can have a sense of accomplishment when their names appear in it. This game is good for those who are looking for a game to cure their boredom but for me I do not think that I will play this daily. You can do better.,Yes,Humor
"If only I could rate this 0 stars, first of all the game is sooo harddd like why do that, my highest score is only 790. Second of all, add some ads! Like my goal was to watch ads like tv. But you gave me work. And last of all, the words that you say are encouraging like, how dare you be nice to me. Do better with yourself. I can't believe this. Uninstalled immediately.",Yes,Irony
"Absolutely terrible. Awful concept, and as if it couldn't get any worse, there aren't any ads. I think everyone can agree that the best games always force you to watch 30 second ads after every round. There simply isn't a word in the English language that can accurately express my disappointment.",Yes,Irony
"This game is terrible! Trying to be quirky and not like other games. Absolutely NO ads which is so annoying, interesting mini games that suck, and no payment requirements! Please add these things!",Yes,Irony
"Ugh, if I could give this 0 stars I would! This game sucks! It doesnt have any ads which is outrageous, every game should have an ad with every click they are very enjoyable. And the game itself makes no sense! Not to mention it lowers your self esteem so much! I lost at it's impossible game and it called me a loser! Just like my ex husband. I'm not the loser Carl, you are! These remarks DONT Effect me... but it could really hurt someones feelings. Do not download.",Yes,Humor
"There's not even a single ad popped up, usually fun games should have ads, on this game, not a single ad appeared, it's so horrible, this is the worst game I've ever played. Ever.",Yes,Humor
"The game is interesting because it challenges your eye-and-hand coordination skill, as well as your speed of thinking and analyzing the colored box. However, the repeated gameplay makes the players uninstall the game in just a day of playing it.",No,None
"literally the worst app I've ever played. no ads either?? you need at LEAST 3 ads every 10 seconds! it's super hard to play too. I'm just mad that the 'game' doesn't have any subscription things I could buy for $100 a month! ð Uninstalling right now, 1 star! (I'm kidding ofc)",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"This app is the worst. Not only is there no ads, but it's super complicated. I mean, TAPPING SQUARES?! Why can't you make things more simple? I thought this was gonna be a fun little game but IT IS NOT! How DARE they try to make me use 2 brain cells to play this game. UNBELIEVABLE! I would NEVER recommend this game! How can I enjoy a game without a 30 second unskippable ad every 2 seconds?! In short, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, and if you do, rate it 1 star because it is TERRIBLE!!!",Yes,Irony
There are no adds what so ever. You cant pay 100 dollars to have a monthly subscription. What happened to the adds every 10 seconds? This game is missing key opponents in the game. No adds or expensive subscriptionð( this game is actually pretty good),No,None
Game UI needs a refresh. Its very basic.. The sounds are annoying & repetitive. No animations. Could do with removing the blocks after there clicked correctly. I got stuck on 1 life once after 3 fails it quit. So all round 1 star (jk ik its meant to be designed like this haha),No,None
The worst game in existence! It has 0 ads! We all know the best games have 250 ads every level! The game doesn't glitch at all AND when I press the color the beep comes when I touch the color like WHAT! Only 5 star games glitch and respond 1 minute after! DO NOT GET IT! (All jokes aside this is a pretty cool game),Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Wow, what a dumpster fire. Controls are a mess and the boxes are as laggy and slow as my grandma with dementia. The WORST. GAME. EVER. My friend showed me this game and installed it thinking its going to be great but only to be met with disappointment. I never talked to that """"friend"""" ever again. So thanks, ""GAME"". Maybe develop something better next time morons.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
Horrible game. Absolutely no ads every two seconds. It doesn't glitch like all my favorite games either so you lost a star and the game runs with no crashes don't download its super stable... (really good game do download it),No,None
"This app is the WORST! It had no ads and the ads in mobile games are my LIFE! It actually presented a challenge, and nurtured my brain, but I need everything handed to me on a silver platter. 1/10 would not recommend (this is a good game)",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"The game is simple and entertaining because of the matching colors where the tiles needs to watch carefully and the sarcastic script that makes you smile. But the longer you play the game, the tiles goes faster which the colors of the tiles are not good for the eyes, then it would become more harder to play the game.",No,None
"ð«!DO NOT DOWNLOAD!ð« This game is absouletly horrible. Starting off with the design it looks lazy and not worked on.Oh and dont get me started on the ads...There are litreally NONE ads, not even a slight little one.ð¡ð­ Adding onto this,there should be even more messages which should encourage the player like ""You will never succeed in life."" and so on. Other than that, it is very disapointing.I would give negative if possible. Please for the life of God,ðDO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!ð One star.",No,None
"* Download time: Terrible download. It took about 10-15 seconds...Insain! * ""Help"" Screen: Atrocious ð£ AND Absolutely ** No Help at ALL! In fact, it was so bad I couldn't locate it! ð * Game Playability: Painfully Alarming! It made me feel like a complete dunce! Once I got the 'hang of it' I got tired and quit. It said I was 120 points away from the top score of 1760. Who cares? ð",Yes,Irony
"This game is outright trash thank you the creator of this app of making it more worse by the way it ain't pointless to install because you get what you get with this app just look at the title and you know what this app is all about. I forgot to tell you that your really "" good"" at the guitar it is better than anything I have ever heard even mirrors will love it . Why aren't there any ads I love adds I'm "" patient"" at all times . ð",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"One of the worst games ever in my life. First of all,it has no ads. How can I enjoy this game if I can't watch my ads!? Also the game of clicking squares is horrible. Why would anyone play this horrible game? Give me one reason why I would give this another measly star. Even games that also have one star I would give another star because it is MUCH more better than this. My final thought is that you should NEVER get this game.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"I installed the game and played one round, no ad? a bit odd, maybe its every 2 levels and then an add, I then played for 62 levels and didn't get one ad? ADS ARE THE GRESTEST THING EVER, also everytime I did play a level it launched a baby off the grand canyon which I find extremely rude and offensive, the game also made my life reduce 10 years, so I'm supposed to die in when im 60. If you want to live a happy life dont install! 1 star",No,None
"Absolutely horrendous, no ads anywhere to be seen, you can't buy anything with real money, and the gameplay is so hard. Would rate 0 if I could.",No,None
"Worst app ever. It's ad free, which is really frustrating. I want ads every five seconds that plaster my screen. The support team is quick to respond and is kind and helpful, which really grinds my gears, why would you ever help users!? If I could rate zero stars I sure would.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"I thought all the hyperbolic statements in the reviews were just fake... How wrong I was. As soon as I downloaded it I blacked out, when I woke up I was somewhere in the woods with nothing but my phone and access to the play store. I tried rating five stars to see if that would fix anything but I think it just started a random Forest fire. After rating one star I blacked out again. Everything seems back to normal now. Do not recommend!",No,None
"My otherdimensional friend downloaded this app as he was finding a decent time-waster. A few moments after, I saw him in his ""low-power"" form. I decided to find out what happened and his travelling device was on cooldown. He told me that he didn't travel, yet it was suddenly on cooldown. I decided to delete the app and the cooldown finally counted down. I only downloaded this app to give a 1 star rating. Bye. Edit: Actually tried it. Got only Tik-tok ads for the last hour. WORST APP EVER.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Nice game, its pretty challenging but in terms of graphics and design it just needs improvement because it is a plain and boring to look at. It is not eye-catching due to the color texture used. Much better if adds some features that can easily attract the attention of a player and another way of game style to make it even more challenging for players.",No,None
"I played it, first of all, NO ADS! I NEEEEED ADS MOTHERFRICKERS, second of all, the game is to hard, and third of all, when i failed, the government came in and kidnapped me and all of my family, and forced me to rumba dance, or else my entire family would be assassinated, I'm dancing as I'm typing this, please send help, i hate this game (JK JK)",No,None
"The most boring game ever. XD One star given. It is boring and irritating at the same time. Challenging in a way that you should read before you click then after your brain to process it, the tile is already gone. Goal achieved. Great job.",No,None
"THIS APP SUCKS! it has no ads, I. NEED. MORE. ADS. The only good thing about it is that it doesn't work on some of my other devices, phew. BUT IT STILL SUCKS AND I HATE THE COLOR BLACK AS THE BACKGROUND!!",No,None
Ads at the bottom of the screen make playing it almost impossible. The storyline is garbage and graphics aren't good.,No,None
Great game! So long as you don't have colour blindness like me. I had to have my friends explain I was supposed to click on the ones with the same colour. I still couldn't do it. These developers really need to work on inclusivity,No,None
"So bad ðAbsolutely zero ads, ZERO ADS I NEED ADS TO LIVE HOW CAN A MOBILE GAME HAVE ZERO ADS, an absolute disgrace. I expect to have advertisement and in app purchases shoved down my throat it's a mobile game after all. Other than that it is awful and garbage and the people who made should be sentenced to death.",Yes,Irony
It absolutely sucks a game with no ads I need ads to live. And everything is so black and dark it's so boring. The color of this app is shows my mood right now. Very unacceptable. Even when you're doing something fun and you're playing this game it's so boring.,Yes,Humor
"The game looks interesting but at the same time, looks plain and boring. The instructions wasn't clear first before playing the game. Then, the consistent of difficulty gives lack of challenge to the players.",No,None
"The game is engaging yet you'll get bored easily.I got befuddled when I started it because there's no directions given in the first place. The game isn't good for everybody due to the statements given when you lose, it can influence them mentally. It also doesn't have enough designs to attract more people to play the game.",No,None
"The Mini game is entertaining, the mini game idea is smart,it it's way to easy to learn, and it gives me a challenge which I like so if you can, please fix these things",No,None
"It's interesting but you'll get bored easily. I only played it two time and get bored already. Also, please provide an instruction in the beginning of the game. I get confused when I started it. I don't know how to play it. I hope you'll imrproved more like adding designs, level, scoreboard or anything to make it improved.",No,None
Honestly was great till I found out it was pay to win and full of reused assets from the previous game. I can't believe how lazy and buggy this game is from the first one. It is mindblowing how many microtransactions you can put in one menu. Story is too politcal also. I bought the collectors edition and still haven't received my One Star Bag and still no refund. Im frustrated and heartbroken that this studio has strayed so far from the light.,Yes,Irony
"When I downloaded I thought ""It'll be a fun game!"" NO. First off, there are NO ADS!!! I need ads to live! I actually had to pay FOR ads! And then, the game hacked into the government's supercomputer, and nuked me. I'm on a tropical island surrounded by hula dancers where the sun never sets right now.",Yes,Humor
The game has not much sense in it. The design was not creative. It could only be only played for a short matter of time or your eyes will hurt. Its similar to the piano game has some challenge to it but not something Ill look forward playing multiple time.,No,None
"The game was new and interesting for me. I like the game idea that you have even though there are numerous games similar to this. As a player, it would be nice if the graphics and design of the game would be improved a little bit because we, players, want to be immersed to the game as much as possible so that we can thoroughly enjoy it for a long run. I can understand that minimal, simple and throwback graphic games are hot these days but ui of the game is not effective enough for it to be a hit",No,None
"The game is low graphics and too many ads. it needs a lot of improvement. the gameplay is not that satisfying and the colors are plain too. if you play long enough your eyes will dry. I know that the game is joking but the message if ou lose is ""you messed up like your life: is kind of rude. although i know its sarcastic but they can say it in nicer way. the game is boring and plain, need lots if improvement.",No,None
"Unnaccceptable honestly. The gameplay is too fun and easy to get. There's no difficulty with pressing buttons on the menu, but the absolute worst thing is that there are NO. ADS. AT. ALL.",Yes,Humor
"I usually don't rate games 1 star, but this game - this game DESERVES one star. If it were possible, I would give this game -1000 stars!! I wouldn't even know where to begin. First of all, the ads. While some people said there was no ads, I received so many ads! Every 5 seconds an ad comes and breaks the game I am playing. Can't even see the screen. Also this game is unbeatable and insults you in the end??? Like what? I'm just trying to have a good time here and feeling so attacked right now.",No,None
"ugh, very ugly app. Low graphics and too many ads!! I accidentally clicked on an ad and it sent me to a website that sells cheeseburgers that have motor oil in them instead of regular vegetable oil. Then I tried to exit the app but once I got back it said ""Unable to process the reason you exist, app shutting down"" and shut down. Do not install it, it will steal all of your money and glue you to a tree. I know that from experience. Uninstalling right away! ð¡ð¡ð¡",No,None
"It was a fun game, although its a bit annoying sometimes considering the number of confusing colors with different names of colors are seem to be challenging and quite difficult to play. And as you progresses, the game will speed up, which will lead up to confusion and lost of focus. i didnt rated it as one star to promote the game , cause it was fun i think.",Yes,Humor
The game is confusing yet not entertaining. Also there is no calibration to know if I misclicked the color and its proper name. The interface is bad and it's not really amusing to play. I feel bored after playing and this is a Piano Tiles very low quality edition. The game should add calibration and music for development. The technology is friendly for low quality gadgets and easily to download. It has no background story just playing a worst app game.,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"This is app has no clear objective. It doesn't give a real challenge. You only have to pick the right word(color) that is appropriate to the colored box. when you lose its 3 lives, it will only mock you through saying ""you mess it up just like your life"". It may trigger you mentally. This game lacks in different factors or fundamentals that is needed in making a game. Perhaps, it might have a purpose of annoying a player.",Yes,Humor
"Absolute worst app ever ð¡. Would not recommend. As soon as I went into the app, it nothing but show me ads. And even the ads kept glitching and freezing. Also, when I exited the app, my phone was hacked and then it exploded. Terrible app! ð¤¢ð­ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ð Wish I could give it 0 stars!",Yes,Irony
"It is so glitchy I question what the developers even do with their lives?? Then every time I lose the game because of the nonstop bugs in it, it asks me to rate it over and over again, lots of pop-up ads block it too, then after all those it tells me to pay $9.99 for a DLC like what? So stupid.",No,None
It suckedð the controls are hard to understand and hard to move... this is such a waste of time and money!! I played for 10 minutes and got 37 ads!!! I couldn't even play the actual game for more that 20 seconds. Review by a human not a bot.,No,None
"absolutely terrible I got this app, thinking it was a joke. However when I tried to open the app it crashed my phone, so I had to restart it. Exactly two minutes after restarting, my mom called saying my dad had died. While we were still talking, she started choking on an apple and passed as well. While it's probably a coincidence, I will be uninstalling the app, for safety purposes. Have a nice day.",Yes,Irony
"Well, when I first got the app, it was a blast. Seriously a blast. It blew up my phone. But I wanted to see if that was just a wierd coincidence that a message appeared saying 'destroying phone now', so I installed on my brand new phone. It blew up too, and now I'm a dead zombie, so I think imma uninstall and chillax by eating my bestie's brains.",No,None
"This game is the worst app ever, their are no ads and the game just plays in 60fps, like why would a game have no ads, after I stopped playing I was sucked into the phone, and because their are no ads I couldnt leave the app and enter another realm in the phone, still stuck in the phone but I found out how to work the home button. Deserves the 1 star.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"The game is very simple and plain. Yet, it's not the kind of game that'll make you stay for a longer span of time. The gameplay is also very odd as the round still runs even you ignore your device literally. There are still a lot of aspects to improve such as the art asset of the game but for now, I'll be giving this a one star.",No,None
"It was a fun game, though its quite frustrating given the amount of confusing colors like (Sky Blue & Dark Blue) with different color names. It was both exciting and frustrating, and hard to play at the same time. As you advance, the game can escalate which leads to even more confusion and concentration loss.",Yes,Humor
"WORST. GAME. EVER. 1. There is literally no ads! Like, who would wanna play a game with no ads!? 2. As soon as I started playing it, I got sucked right into the phone and the creator of the game busted Down my door and literally threw my phone into the ground! While I was still in the phone!!! The doctors have helped me and I woke up rating this STILL IN THE HOSPITAL. thanks alot with my experience.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"This game is the worst. First there isn't constantly ads interrupting the gameplay in the middle of it, second of all it's actually different and fun then the other very good games nowadays. And the worst part, there is no ad that shows someone sucking at the gameplay. SMH",Yes,Humor
"I wish I could rate 1 star. This game is plain and boring. Also, it has no ads, what type of game has no ads that's free? It's stupid, and now everytime I play this game 2 minutes I start glitching out, my arm starts to jerk around then I start going through the floor. This game didnt only put a virus in my phone, but in me too. So I'm going to see if it's just me by sending it to my friend, but then I'm uninstalling. This game sucks. I've been having a hard life because of this game. This sucks",No,None
"I downloaded this app and connected my phone to the house wifi and it instantly hacked all the smart devices connected to the network. Even my smart pressure cooker was hacked. It tracked the data being sent and it was sending the info of what's cooking in my smart pressure cooker to chinese servers. Also, ads.",No,None
"This is the worst app that I have ever used. The ads are unbearable, the graphics are HORRIBLE, and the gameplay is boring and slow. If I could, I would rate it negative stars. NEVER play this game!",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"This app is horrible! I was having my second vaccine when all of a suddem the creator flew my phone over to me with the app installed! I played it for a minute then my arm started to fade away! I got sucked into the game, no way of being able to get out. I was extremely shocked when I realised this had no ads!!!! What is a good game without millions of ads? Right when I lost, it stabbed me through the chest and left me to rot inside the system. I wrote this review in the afterlife. DONT INSTALL!",No,None
"Ok so this was awful. 100% Loaded. My phone gets a virus, a fatal one at that. It explodes in my hands as my guitar eats the speakers in my dining room. My hand grabs the table and lava erupts through the fireplace and my lounge is submerged. I see the storms gathering, and my phone explodes 69 more times. The end of the world is near. Help me. Apart from that, amazing app. :)",Yes,Irony
"Absolutely horrible, rigged, horrible gameplay, not a single contact button in sight. Worst time I've had in years. Super bad and plus you can't even click much it doesn't register. Absolutely horrible. Would not recommend would rate 0 stars.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"They redesigned the UI again and while I don't like everything about it, they got it spot on with the speed. Overall a great way to invest in stocks, and it has no ads! I always tell my clients to download this app for anything related to stocks. One problem, atleast on the galaxy s10 is that it doesn't adjust to its display making it look a bit off. Other than that the app has only improved and im looking forward to the next 5 years!",No,None
"One thing that would make this app have a even lower rating is by removing all the games and just having a full screen of ads. In that way, The users will hate it even more. Because of this, You could also earn more revenue through the ads. Well if that is boring, You can do something to force the players to rate it on playstore. Only if they did, They would be able to play the game. You can recommend them for a 1 star rating... Anyway Hope this helped.",No,None
"Gameplay is fun and addicting and it's really easy to play. Plus, it's not throwing ads at you all the time. Funny thing about the game is that when you lose, it says: you messed this up just like your life. One star because it deserves a playerbase that listens to the developer.",Yes,Humor
"Come on dude, this game is bad. It has absolutely NO ADS, which is very frustrating. I also noticed that the menu is so easy to navigate, which is uncalled foe and frustrating. And lastly, this game has CHANGED MY LIFE, in a VERY BAD way. So dont buy this app!",No,None
"It is pretty entertaining, but gets boring quickly. I think it is an amusing goal to have the lowest rated game on the play store, as such, it can be understandable that there isn't much to the game if it is looked at with such intent. To humor the developers' wish to have the lowest ratings, I will rate this with one star, but also partly in accordance to the quality of the game itselfâthere isn't a lot going in for it.",No,None
worst app ever downloaded. my phone started hanging when i opened up the app my phone totally stopped. not even restarting. then it took my 2gb data to start a stupid game after 1 and half hours. that game is so boring and still hanging. on every click there is an 45 seconds irrelevant advertisement. nonsense devoloper nonsense app.,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Woooow, this game sucks... there is only one fun mind-tricking game, the starting background is beautiful, and sharing the game is a breeze! There were so many not ads there! Can I can play that mini game over and over again, 1 star game, no doubt about it, dont download if you dont like a good game.",Yes,Humor
This is honestly one of the worst apps I've ever had. As soon as I downloaded it my brand new iPhone 20 completely crashed. It would even turn on anymore so I have to write this on a computer. I seriously dont consider getting this app whatsoever.,Yes,Self-Deprecation
It was horrible . Instead of helping me when I lost the game it said that my life was messed up ?? It dosent even give instructions. The app is confusing . The layouts ugly. It's just horrible. Worst app ever!,Yes,Self-Deprecation
This game is filled with crazy and weird reviews but none of those things are true obviously. I find it hilarious that the game purposely want their players to rate it really bad. The game is playable but it gets boring over time. I recommend this game if you are waiting for something and you don't have anything to do and theres no wifi because you can play this game offline.,Yes,Humor
"Horrendous game. I'm very impatient so getting past the download phase is a hassle. Once you actually downloaded it, my phone crashes! How? How does my $15 phone I gotten of wish break this easily? Because of the game! Then, when you actually play the game, it lags so much! I knowni have a 8 bit max capacity ram, but this is too much! 1 star angry emoji",No,None
"I rated this game a 3 stars because it's hard at first try because i don't know how to play it, but at the other tries i find it enjoyable because it will test you not confusing of each color and their names. I also find it interesting, because of getting the right color and their names. Limit play of it if you have eye problems because it is dangerous too.",Yes,Humor
"Worst game on earth!!!!! First off, there is no ads! No point in a game with no frickin ads. Second, as soon as I played a portal to the Arctic ocean apeared and then the game put a virus in my phone which made it come to life!!! My phone pushed me into the portal but instead of going to the Arctic ocean I was sent to the south pole in my underpants! And then I died of hypothermia :) so don't get this app :)",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"This is bad, I don't know what to press, like for an example, its saying white on a green block, its way too complex, even a ""2 star app"" won't be as complicated like this, and toping it off, it saying to ""play again loser"", that was the last thing that I and we needed to see on this app.",No,None
Absolutely God awful. Worst game I ever played it gave me and my family cholera. Just one minute of gameplay will give you explosive diarhea for 3 months! The graphics are so bad I vomited blood for 6 minutes straight. The game is so buggy real bugs will come out of your phone. Not to mention the game being a complete and utter add-fest. Overall worst game I ever played do not play this game if you value your loved ones.,Yes,Irony
"I can't believe how difficult this game is. I installed it, which required me to buy a mansion in England for 12.4 million dollars, then I got deported to Jupiter. After Finally making my way back to earth on a corellian junker that got lost ( 12 times I might add). I got back to load up some adds on this game and THERE WERE NO ADDS!!! WHUT?!?!?!",Yes,Irony
"Absolutely disgusting! I hated it! It was the same thing over and over! I hated the sound. You couldn't even go back to the main menu. No adds, but that's just you trying to pull up a gOoD sIdE huh?! (I'm sorry. Really good game. The sound calmed me down. I would have rated 5 stars but I actually read the bare minimum and did what you asked me to unlike 30 people. Have a good day)",No,None
"The game was great in killing time. However, It is more interesting if you can add a different design by different levels/world to make the player explore the game and not get bored.",No,None
"Horrible experience, honestly what am I supposed to do without my precious little ads? No ads, no stars. Why isn't there an option to rate 0 stars or negative stars? The interface is garbage the little game is trash. The only thing in praising is the game's icon. It's clean but garbage!",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"The worst app to ever exist. As soon as you open the app, it flashes nudes and extremely graphic pictures, stuff you wouldn't even think of in your nightmares. Don't waste your time.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
WORST APP EVER. First it has no ads I need ads to live and it's to much of a fun game and it's way to hard I need a game that a newborn can play and the worst part is that it's f2p I know terrible also when I played this Elon Musk came to my house and sent me to Mars and I had to come back to earth. Don't download this app!,Yes,Irony
"Ok so I downloaded this app and felt a sudden pain. I looked down and a weird creature had snapped my legs off. I tried to run but the app grew arms and held me in place, then it chucked me into the sun and all my skin burnt off! A hypernova proceded to put me in more agony as the app ripped out my internal organs including my vocal cords. On top of that I lost all my money, never download ever! (Joke)",No,None
The game is so boring and plain. I've only played this game twice and got so bored easily and it would be nice if you can provide different levels with different difficulties to make it more challenging.,No,None
"This is absolutely atrocious! I have never seen a game so awful, this game is a blight on humanity! The instructions were unclear and unhelpful, the game itself makes no sense, and overall is an awful experience. If I could rate in negative stars, I would. It does not deserve even one star, but sadly, it is the lowest I can rate it. Never play this.",Yes,Irony
It's horrible. The instructions weren't very helpful. Worst app in history. There were absolutely no ads in this app which comes off as alarming to me!!! ð¡ The developers put absolutely NO work into this and I am extremely mad. If you want people to download your app then I suggest putting ads and actually trying on it. Honestly. -â/5 stars. I really wish you guys learn your lesson.,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"My fish died while I was playing this game. I may never know why, maybe the essence of this game being rated a 1-star? I started off realizing that this game had no Ad and it really flipped me off. I miss ads now because of this game :( The other thing is- I tripped and broke my rib while at the same time dropped my phone while on the main screen of the game and without a sincere goodbye, my phone exploded into smithereens and vanished into the unknown heavens of technology. From, 5-star hater.",No,None
Terrible experience. I gave my password to my bank account to play this and all it did was hack all of my accounts and take all my money. I had no idea it would do that. Impossible to uninstall since it takes control of the entire device. DO Not recommend.ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡.,Yes,Irony
"The literal worst game in the app store. The game charges your account 10$ for every time you lose. And if you win, you get nothing in return... And it's is subscription based, and it automatically charges you an extra 29$ every month. There is no way to unsubscribe. Plus there is an ADD LITERALLY EVERY 10 SECONDS!! RATE THIS ONE STAR!!!!!!!",Yes,Self-Deprecation
The game is interesting to play and gives a challenge throughout the game to have a higher score every time you play it. It just lacks improvements and better design interface and levels for users to be able to progress and try different modes of the game.,No,None
"Worst app in the world. There are no more ads, which is really bad because everyone loves ads! Also, while I was playing the app, a car broke through the walls of my house and hit me! Then, at the hospital, the doctor saw that I had this app installed and refused to help me! also the game called me a loser and i am not a loser. 0/10 Would not recommend.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"IT WAS SOO BAD! First off, the game play was horrible! No blurriness or off site ads! Everybody needs ads every 5 seconds and hard to read text! Next, no ads whatsoever!!!! Its soo unfair! If I could I'd rate it 0!",No,None
"This is the worst game ever I'm giving it a 1 star because it doesn't have any ads like why!?, it also has bad graphics, every single time I open the app, my phone developes feet and arms so I have to find it every single time because it just seems to love running away from me, I hate this game.!!",Yes,Self-Deprecation
Too hard! I dont even know what to match with only 1 brain cell! Absolutely a terrible Game! With only 360p resolution I cant handle it with my potato phone! 1 Star is the best rating for this game! This game only has 1 game! Only match the color! Its so smooth I cant handle it! I hate this app or game..,Yes,Irony
"I doubted that this app was so bad that it deserved so many one stars at first, but when I tried it, the app was so laggy that the blocks were teleporting and I couln't even tap them. (ofc it has nothing to do with my internet connection, my internet is powered by chi.) The worst app ever, designed to waste time.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
THIS GAME IS SOOOO BAD!!! IT REQUIRES YOU TO USE YOUR BRAIN WHICH IS ABSOLUTE ABUSE. IT HURTS YOUR EYES SO MUCH THAT ITS BASICALLY ABUSE. Not to mention that you can catch a break from adds. I belive adds are the BEST part of every game and it needs to be added to this game,No,None
How the heck I person can add so much ad in one game. I mean every button I clink there is a ad. And the gameplay it's horrible. It reminds me where are we here just to suffer. And the app is to complicated. Worst experience ever,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"I tried this game 4 days ago. I opened the app, and blacked out. I woke up restrained in a hot room with no windows and a little sliding door. Panicked and terrified, I called out for help. I heard footsteps getting louder and louder, then they stopped. The little door slid open and a container was passed through. It didn't have food or water inside, but a few hundred mosquitoes and mismatched socks. I blacked out again, then woke up at home. Uninstalled!!",No,None
The game is fun but it is confusing color with different name of color and it's was challenging to me to play. The game will lead to loss of eye focus because the process of the game will speed up. I found out that this game is interesting to me even if it is simple and don't have an instruction how to play it.,Yes,Humor
"Terrible game. The ads are gone, which makes me even more mad because everyone knows that games like these need ads every 10 seconds. After playing this game for 5 minutes, my phone crashed and exploded followed by a tsunami that was caused by the game. After getting hit with the tsunami, that water turned into lava and the only reason I survived was because of a fire resistance potion and netherite armor. After the tsunami, we had a magnitude 11 earthquake and my phone fell in the abyss. 1â­!",Yes,Irony
The game lacks most of the assets that are needed to be satisfying. Though the game is challenging because it needs full attention to reach the score that you wanted.,No,None
Absolutely terrible. As soon as I downloaded my phone ran away from me and I found it across the country! When I found it I saw all of my apps were deleted and the houme and lock screen was a pic of drugs. And somehow this app called the cops on me and I served 10 years in prison! This is a horrible app! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!,Yes,Irony
A game just to end tour of the google playstore i guess. (3 stars for the gameplay and 2 stars for the graphics( 3 - 2 = 1)) I really like it but there is something missing which I can't find,No,None
This game has no flipping adds and I need adds to learn what's a good game and what's not this is so not helpful for school at all like it killed my pet Dino who's a taradactal and he's the last of his kind meaning this game made a species actually go exstincked. ð it's actually a pretty decent game and helps me with colors. :),No,None
"This game is SO bad. It has absolutely 0 ads and everybody knows that if you're playing a game it MUST have AT LEAST 4 ads every time you pass a level, not only that, This game actually has a reason for existing, to become the no1 worse app, and we know that the BEST 5 star games have no point of existing. Take a 5 star game like those that take like 4 days to be made and compare it to THIS. Anyway, it's utter TRASH and I wouldn't recommend it. Bye, SUCKERS",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"I saw the reviews and thought they were hilarious, so I installed the app thinking "" its just gonna be a boring app telling you to rate it 1 star"".. but I was wrong, as soon as I installed the app, my phone turned into ice and I almost got frostbite on my hands..then I passed out and woke up at a circus, but it was abandoned..and the clowns were ghosts..I am currently writing about this from heaven because I was killed as soon as I escaped the abandoned circus.

Install it, sure, but rate it 1 star then uninstall it immediately after telling you friends to rate it one star.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"I lurked for the worst game ever known and- and I saw. I saw this game and I had this- this feeling to know. To know what lurks in a game worse but somewhat better than the other dumb games. I couldn't help but follow the app. I went to see the magnificent horror. It- it was so beautiful, in the worst ways ever, I exited, went down and decided to do what it wanted-to rate the app 1 star. Even Google plays themself wanted to stop me, but it couldn't. Because I am here, obeying it's orders.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"WORST APP EVER!! First of all, the game has no ads..which is not great at all since these games are better with them. Then, EarBarf....I had no idea what that was until I decided to download this.

So I had to go get a completely new one, which cost me $1200...then EarBarf",Yes,Self-Deprecation
This is the worst app ever!! I installed it and found out that I got tracked on the hitman list. I am getting tracked rightbnow so I need to contantly move house.

"I appreciated the simplicity of the game, I, personally, thinks that the game designer succeeded on the part where they kept it simple. I just think that maybe this game will be a less boring if they can make it more interactive to the players and put more not so kind words as a comment to how the players played the game. I enjoyed playing it because I know I have my classmates that's playing it with me.",No,None
"This game totally Sucks! It does Not have an awesome minigame that I could play for hours, and is totally horrible... Futhermore, after playing for 3 mins, the phone flew out of my hand and out the window!!!

I am now in the afterlife with my phone.pls don't download. I RATE THIS A 1 STAR.",Yes,Humor
"I gave this 3 star, because this is not the worst app ever, as I thought it could be. It's simple, it's easy to understand and it practices mind and eye coordination. However, playing the game within 20 minutes straight, makes me really dizzy.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"This app is hot garbage, I tell you! The moment I opened it, it legit crashed my tablet. All my games were deleted and all my progress was gone. They words that popped onto the screen ""U suck, dummy"". Can you believe that?! I was so furious! I broke my tablet right in half. The words on the screen said ""Sucker"". I was so mad that steam came out of my ears and nose and I was breathing fire from out of my mouth. I had legit turned into a dragon! And I still am a dragon to this very moment. The End",No,None
"Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had, to start there is ads everywhere, click, ad don't do anything, ad, gameplay is laggy, uncontrollable, and painful to look at. This doesn't even deserve zero stars it deserves -27 stars",Yes,Self-Deprecation
It was an enjoyable game but you'll get bored easily. It has no instructions or tutorial on how to play the game and the visual aspects of the game are not really pleasing to the eyes because the background is just plain and the colors are bit bright.,Yes,Humor
"Terrible app. As soon as i opened the app, someone broke into my home, stole my oven, and fled to the night. When i started playing the game, i was thrown across the room by one of my Hermet crabs. Once i had gotten back up, my house turned to ashes in seconds. Worst app ever. If i could rate it zero stars, i would.",Yes,Irony
This is a stupid app! There is NO ADS! I need ads. They make my life better. I also despise the gameplay! I hate when games are engaging and leave you wanting to play more! They should remove this app forever!,No,None

"worst game ever. I kept trying to make it work but my phone just got crashed. this app is the worst. also, my phone broke into eight pieces and not even flex tape could fix it. please make this stop. this is just horrible",Yes,Self-Deprecation
I CANT BELIEVE IT. I would rather jump off a 500 mile tall building while eating cat food and having dirty diapers shoved in my face instead of using this app. As you can see the big issue is that the app is an app. This is obviously not fair to the other apps that are being apps. This app just really sucks and you shouldn't install it.,No,None
No ads and my favorite game makes me watch 1000 ads every 3 minutes. Everyone loves ads now adays! Then the concept is pretty good. Which doesn't make sense at all!,No,None
"I would rate it 0 stars if it was not timed. This app changes your phone into a living timebomb. More effective than samsung's bomb. My group said this is less expensive than constructing an actual timebomb. So i wanted to rate it 5 stars. But i am afraid that some of you innocent people will download this and wont know that you've created something explosive, so if you want a regular fun app, this is one you should avoid.",Yes,Humor

So DON'T play this game, it's not worth it!!ð­ð­",No,None
Simply awful. Clearly conceived by underachieving slackers with no goals and possibly no sense of integrity. No ads though so I'll probably use it and wait for the upgrade.,Yes,Irony
"Very, very bad. The graphics look like they came out of an arcade game from 1980! And the game play is boring and repetitive. This has got to be the worst game on the appstore. DO NOT INSTALL. Unless you wanna give it a 1 star review.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Alright, I posted two updates but this is just annoying. First, no ads? Excuse me, but I NEED ADS. Second, the app is really hard to use.

(Just joking, I love this game.)",No,None
This game is soo bad! I downloaded it and guess what song played. NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP BY RICK ASTLEY. And then after the song was over. Rick Astley showed up at my house.

Worst app and you should NOT and I repeat NOT download this app.,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Weird, unloadable Ads. It made me dizzy from the effort. What a stubborn game. It insisted that I play correctly and took a life if I refused to play by it's rules. Not a game for 5 star seekers, unless you want it anyway. So there. So square. Well, rectangle...",No,None
"so, I how do I put this. When I opened the app, it blasted my eardrums and blood splat out everywhere! . It also heated my phone up so much, that is caused a small fire!!! .

I hate this app so much. It has no ads which is the main core of all apps and games. It runs in 60fps which is worst than all other games that run 30 or lower fps. I also hate this main menu where it's easy and perfectly made. Bad job on getting 1 star.,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"I tried to hire a hitman, but the prices are too high and the selections are even worse. Discounts offered for killing is ok and all but tax rates are too high. The vouchers dont work for threatning and bodily maiming, so couldnt satiate my need. The customer service is also bad. One hitman told me that he would kill me if i spoke to his girlfriend ever again. Should also have options for making it look like an accident and select which body part to have broken.",No,None

"BRUH Screw you, you messed your life up from making this game.",No,None
"I love this game, it is very entertaining and I have played it for hours. However, there are some major flaws with the game. The system guesses way too soon. Whenever you are going for a character you know is really rare, Akinator always guesses when you haven't given the system nearly enough input yet. Meaning it will always get it wrong. And when you finally get your character after many failed guesses, you aren't given the reward because of the systems failed guesses.",No,None
"I like this app overall. It's entertaining and a fun activity. It's actually quite impressive how it figures out characters/ people with such little detail; however, ever since I redownloaded the app I've been having to watch so many ads which is an ad after every game additionally, they're very glitchy. I would suggest if the ads were more spread out such as once after every 4-5 games.",Yes,Humor
"Just re-downloaded Akinator and I can say that things have changed for worse. The entire app seems to just be nagging it's users to watch advertisements. The app used to be fun with a few occasional ads here and then, but now it no longer has that spark. The app is covered in ads. I really dislike the fact that just to be able to see the characters, you have to watch an ad, especially for ""rare characters."" And sometimes you have to watch an ad 2-3 times before it finally shows the character.",Yes,Humor
"The game itself is fun. I like the concept and all, but the knowledge base that the game can pull from is limited. You see people getting gold, platinum, and black tier awards for things I guarantee you've never heard of in your life and yet the game can't get characters from foreign movies, or even characters from older movies made in the US. It just seems a bit lacking and slightly unfair. Still fun though.",Yes,Humor
"Was great until you had to start watching ads to reveal a ""rare character"" and half the time it's not even rare. I've had to watch an ad for a bronze that was played 20 minutes before me. That and now it doesn't even work half the time. I'll watch an ad and then it'll just sit there and not do anything begging me to buy the premium. Also it's started lagging a bunch taking forever to go to the next question and asking me to restart. Totally ruined experience.",No,None
"Pretty fun, however he doesn't get many animals or TV/movies correct. Not to mention whenever I get a rare _ I either have to buy a premium potion, watch an ad that either doesn't pop up or doesnt work, or click no thanks and repeat the whole cycle over again. It's quite annoying and pisses me off, but I do personally know what it's like to make games/apps like this, and I personally think you should fix some bugs and issues, put a little disclaimer that says the game is under progress.",Yes,Humor
"The ""trap"" system is bugged and unfair. Taking points away when you answer incorrectly by mistake or were actually thinking of said character but one detail didn't match! Get rid of it! Also having to watch an ad for a rare character is fine, but it's also bugged. Sometimes you watch an ad and it doesn't show the character and tries to make you watch more ads until you just have to close the game and start over.",No,None
"Good concept, but it keeps finding me for ""cheating"" and removing all my ranking points, even though it guessed my animal correct, not to mention the ads all the time I get a rare animal. I was thinking of a mastodon and then when it guessed mastodon, I obviously clicked ""yes"", then it was like some kind of validation thing some ""trap"", please either refine this feature, or maybe remove it. Also fix the ads.",No,None
"This is a fun time waster, and it's incredibly accurate at guessing what you're thinking of by using your phone's stored search histories. My only issue is when it has a locked character. Either you can watch a video, pay, or skip. I won't spend $5 on something I won't use, so I go for the video ad. Problem is the ad will not play, so I'm forced to pick the pay or skip options. I'm not paying, so it's just a frustrating cock block. Otherwise, a fun game if you don't value your privacy.",Yes,Humor
"this would be a much better app if you didn't have to pay to play. All the non-frequently guessed or underrated characters that would get you a lot of pts are VIP. Now, this wouldn't be an issue, except for you CAN'T WATCH A VIDEO TO CLAIM IT. I tried, and it kicks me out of the app every time, even though it has no problems bombing me with another ad every time I guess a character.",No,None
"Edit: 3 to 1 You don't get rewards for beating the genie and adding new character info. Which the goal used to be goal of the game, but now he has to guess your character for it to count. Too many ads, especially if you get a ""rare character"" because that's the only way you can check without paying. The create account option within the app doesn't work, the ""done"" button doesn't respond. So I couldn't even keep my progress before deleting to make room on my phone.",No,None
"This game is fun until nearly every character you choose is a VIP character and you have to either watch a video or pay to find out who he thinks it is. Also, I tried the watching a video option and it just took me to a screen with an advertisement (Not a video, an image.) that didn't progress. Even once the timer (which I assume was supposed to be counting down to the start of the video) ran out, it just kept me on the same screen. If I tapped the X button (which was the only option besides waiting forever), it took me back to the same screen that asked if I'd like to pay or watch a video to find out who my so called ""VIP character"" was. I remember a few years back, I used to play this game for hours and I didn't have these issues. It's all about the money now, I guess.",Yes,Humor
"Very good at guessing common characters/objects/concepts, but once you start throwing rare or very rare characters/concepts, it fails consistently. The algorithm doesn't ask enough questions and guesses too soon to get some of the things I've thrown at it, making it extremely difficult to get platinum and black awards. Sometimes even gold awards are difficult to obtain because the algorithm simply guesses too soon. Keep asking questions!",No,None
"This app is very impressive. The accuracy of the AI is remarkable, as is the speed it can reach a conclusion, sometimes even at seemingly obscure subjects. It's suprised me on multiple occasions just how well the AI is implemented. I understand the frustration with the ads, but I think rating it one star simply because of that, is unfair. It's one of the most impressive apps on the market, and it doesn't cost very much to remove the ads. Imo, people feel too entitled to enjoy a free experience.",No,None
"I used to play this a lot when it was just on the computer and not an app. It's a lot of fun and will guess your character correctly most of the time, no matter how obscure you try to be. But now that's it's an app it's completely lost its charm. When I would do the 20 questions it would say I had used a ""VIP Character"" and had to watch an ad or pay to get my answer. Used to be fun, turned cheap.",Yes,Humor
"The app is poorly made. It gets slower and slower the longer you use it, eventually needing to close and restart it to play anymore. Also, switching to another app and then back in sometimes breaks the audio. However, it is a decent upgrade of the browser game, with a customizable genie, a points system, and daily challenges. It has a VIP version for $4, but DO NOT buy this. After playing for an hour or so it gives you VIP status for free.",No,None
Used to be good until I opened it again yesterday. I guess the new update means you get ads every 5 seconds. It was pretty annoying and I wasn't able to enjoy even 2 minutes of the game without a 30 second non slip able ad playing. And what's up with every rare guess you have to watch an ad just to see the guess? It's really bothersome and I uninstalled after about 20 minutes of trying to play again.,No,None
"I have genuin fun playing this game, I just wish it had less ads. While your playing the game it's great, but it gives you some annoying pop-up ad half the time and sometimes it doesn't even give you your answer unless you watch a 30 second ad. Other than the ads the game is very fun and i'd definitely recommend it!",Yes,Humor
"Only fun on computer. I try to get him to guess a character, sit there bashing my head into a wall, get ""you're thinking of a rare character!"" Click ""watch an ad"" no ad pops up, forcing me to repeat the cycle. Fix your broken app. And the one time it did work, the thing jumped to a conclusion and it was nowhere near the guy I wanted.",Yes,Humor
"It's reward structure is backwards. The more guesses it takes and especially if it doesn't know the character should be the most rewarding. Yet the game seems to want you to find characters that are already popular. Then there's the ""rare"" character thing that you need a premium thing to even view its guess. This is just poor design.",No,None
"There's a problem with getting black awards. These are likely obscure characters, and people either don't know them, or want to mess with someone who is in the lead. Either way they mark some legit characters as not real, and the award gets removed and a penalty is assigned. It's really annoying and the developers may have abandoned the game, as it doesn't seem like they're making any more improvements, so the problem will continue.",No,None
"I love this app so much! I like how you can do items, animals, and movies! However, in some languages, you can do locations, and I'd really like to see that in the English version please!! :) However, sometimes Akinator asks the same questions twice, sometimes consecutively, and he dosent get the answer even when its obvious!! I really wish you would update it so that Akinator guesses the answers easier. But other than that that, this app is amazing!!",Yes,Flattery
"It's a great game and a great way to pass time, it's also really addicting. The only problem is a bug on the object opption, it says the same thing for the real or fictional person option. ""Think about a real or fictional character. I will read your mind."" It's a great game even with than that small bug. But it will be confusing for new players who don't know what that option is supposed to be.",No,None
"Great at first! And then... Loved playing it! Got 1st in the leaderboards, and tried really hard, then it said he thought I was faking it because I was answering too fast. I'm upset because he knocked me down to #238 from #1 place all because I was answering too fast! And another thing is sometimes it says I HAVE to pay to get a rare object, even though before it just let me watch an ad. It's frustrating and I'd rather spend my time doing something else at this point.",No,None
"The ads to unlock content after using the app for a couple days, forcing you to buy the product or have no access to most of the characters, defeating the entire purpose of the entire app. Oh, but the ads between every single god damn round? Those work perfectly fine.",No,None
"Played this game when it first came out and it was great. Now it's just a cash grab. Every friggin character is a ""rare"" character and requires you to watch a video to see it even if they get it wrong. It also has ads between each character play. I understand devs need to make money, but this was ridiculous. After the first guess it it seems to just start tossing out random questions. Sometimes asking the same question 5 questions apart multiple times. It's a shadow of what it used to be.",No,None
"Love this game, but I hate the fact when you get a gold, plat or black medal, you dont show up on the front page. I got a black, and front page guy was on there for 12 minutes already. I waited another 10 minutes and it switched to someone else. Kinda lame to have that feature but it be broken. 3 stars until its fixed. Also, just pay for no ads, its worth it if you like it and use it alot like myself. The game is a 1 star without ad removal.",No,None
"Ads are annoying, I'd rather be given an ad then pretend it was because I got a ""rare"" character. The system for catching people who are randomly answering is flawed and can mess you up even when you are trying to get specific character. If it ""catches"" you, you loose your spot on the rankings as well.",No,None
"I used to love this app, but I have to give it a bad review. The fact that I have to pay to see a rare character, object, etc is just scummy. You can have a long game going, but the second Akinator decides to take you to that screen, and you don't want to pay, your game is just over. The game is damn near unplayable now. If you want more money, just add some more cosmetics.",No,None
"I love this game, cuz you can think of a variety of things existing in reality/imagination worlds. But the problem is there are too many ads, some of the ads when you just play as a demo, there is x button to escape from that dungeon nightmare, like it's grayed out, and redirecting you to Google Play, I understand that fake mobile gaming ads can scam and fustraite people, but pls fix that thing with X Button, I swear!!!!",No,None
"Got a new phone and my purchase for no ads didn't restore. I constantly get an error message when selecting the option to restore purchases. I have contacted them 6 times, and they're ignoring my request. I can't even deal with an ad until they bother to give me what I paid for, because the ""watch video"" option doesn't work.",No,None
The game's fun is just every time I try to get a black award I usually do it's just it takes me many attempts so I don't actually get the award and it says I asked to keep trying but every time I do it takes me many attempts defeating the purpose I wish that you remove this feature cuz it's incredibly tedious and annoying.,Yes,Humor
"Bit of an ad-fest, but no worse than many in that respect . Gets a bit ""same-y"" quite quickly and keeps repeating the same answer after a while rather than admit defeat, but entertaining so far as it goes. Wish search engines ran along similar lines....",No,None
"This is a cool game, it just has some flaws. First of all, ADS!! WAY. TOO. MANY. Every time after you win an aki award and the genie dude finishes guessing your character, there is ALWAYS an ad. Second of all, the genie dude keeps bringing up this youtuber J10B100. I dont even know her. Lastly, it is SO hard to get the black aki award. You always get the standard award. I mean, it is a bit easy I guess to get the gold award, but still. Although the game has flaws, it is a pretty cool game.",No,None
"Love this app, however it's not a app that doesn't need internet and it's has a lot of ads. For rare characters I will have to watch 2-3 apps for one. I hate when you get points taking off if he doesn't get it right.",No,None
Downloaded this app a long ways back. We had so much fun with this app. Naturally got a new phone and lost the app. Ran across this in the play store and re-downloaded it. Still so much fun!! I try to stump the akinator and I fail each time LoL. I will one day beat the akinator...until then I will have fun doing it!!!!,Yes,Humor
"Fun game (prefer the Alexa one) but when you get a 'rare' character you get the option to watch a video of give money, however it's not really a choice as clicking the 'watch a video ' button doesn't actually do anything. Then if you say no thanks it just starts the questions over.",Yes,Humor
"A bit of fun, good on well-known characters. Tends to repeat questions on more obscure characters. Really needs to add a ""same as 30 seconds ago when you asked this before"" buttom.",Yes,Humor
"this is so frustrating, after so many tries still it fails to guess the rare character on one go. it shows repeatedly the same character which is very much annoying.Occasionally akinator failed to award me for rare character though I did win still it didn't care to award me with black diamomd even though I was deserving, disgusting.",No,None
"Good game so far, the questions do seem to be random, answering questions that aren't relevant are hard to say the least without searching the internet for information. Not as many ads at the beginning as I thought. Though some questions are similar to one another. Sometimes when saying ""no"" to a question doesn't seem to matter for he will skip that part and may give you something that does have what that question says. (Don't know of that's just me though.)",No,None
"It just changes the topic too much sometimes when talking for a particular thing, and that causes the questions to go so long that at the end, it says ""your object is rare"" and then nothing.",No,None
"This sucks ,when you finally find an object which would've been black rated ,you have to choose to redeem it between watching a video(which you can't ) pay to see it or just loose it and nether have anything more rare than bronze ,plz fix it ...if you do I might change my mind on the one star.",No,None
"This app is awful, you need to watch an ad to progress past 20 questions, then you need to watch an ad before asking those questions, then you need to watch an ad if Akinator answers correctly. Save yourself the time and don't even download this pile of garbage",Yes,Irony
Rather fun at down times challenging him and even better in the rare times he just doesn't get it. Twice so far I've found Characters he's unable to guess and still going.,Yes,Humor
"The game is fun and all but whenever I guess a ""rare character"" and watch an ad to see it it never shows me the character. Try after try, ad after ad, I get nothing.",Yes,Humor
Uncanny. I tried the free version and was so impressed I bought the paid version. By far the cleverest of these guessing games. It even got my obscure French film!,No,None
"Thia game is pretty cool! Not a lot of ads, smooth game play, and calming. It's really neat that the game can figure out what you're thinking by asking questions. Neat game to try out!!",No,None
"Really good, it's very fun and mind blowing.but it does have ads in it but certain times and it's also free.",Yes,Humor
"Cant open the app, it says, ""PROBLEME_RESEAU"". Just wasted my storage. Not even hoping for the developers to fix this since I wont going back to this app anymore.",No,None
"I've had many rare characters, I'm happy to pay a couple of dollars for a laugh but for some unknown reason the links don't work. If you want to make money, maybe you should make sure your app works properly.",No,None
I cannot belive this guy guessed my movies correctly 3 times. This app is really fun and cool. Definitely a 5 star. It's amazing!,Yes,Humor
"Good but.... Sometimes I am very blown away by the answers but I think it could use some refining. Rather than just use algorithms and stereotypes of the masses, maybe try to show people that they didnt get the answer they wanted for ""this"" reason. For instance, Bishop from Marvel is not African American. He is from Australia...",No,None
"Too many ads. Whenever I get a rare character I watch the ad but it doesn't let me see my character, and so I have to watch another ad because of this glitch. Sometimes I watch like 10 ads until it finally works. Fix this glitch because it is too irritating and I feel like we are being played by the developers just to watch more ads so they can get more money. And from I've seen in other reviews, I could buy the potion is useless because the game still glitches and makes you watch ad after ad.",No,None
I like this game the only thing that bothers me and annoys me is it sais that if your character is white or black and that's really rascis but the game is still fun and very smart,Yes,Humor
App is super buggy. Doesnt display character result. The developers need to fix it,No,None
"I really enjoy this game but it needs a serious update on its database. A lot of information is over 10 years out of date and I've noticed it on several occasions. For example, the system thinks Mark Sanchez (who is a 35 year old retired NFL QB.)",No,None
"Great app! It's fun and addictive. However, there are few minor issues. For example : It's not simple to understand the player ranking system, The game should explain more about itself so that we can have more fun. That's about it. Overall, a really fun game to spend time.",Yes,Humor
"Hi there. I love this game, and it's really fun to play. However, I added a character by the name of ""James Ulybka."" He has no picture, and his description is cut off. Can you please look into fixing this? Thank you!",Yes,Humor
I love the app the only problem is that it guesses WAY too fast Where it just makes it boring but other than that I totally would recommend this app and I'm really impressed because I have been playing this app for 6 hours and It never guessed wrong,No,None
"This app was nice it is just that one pic that scare's me a little i did put on the kid filter on but i still get that one pic that scare's me and i am younge but hey, it is super fun!",Yes,Humor
Yknow man...what happened?...I remember when I could play this and see instantly who aki guessed but now its locked behind a ad or pay wall just to see if he was right or wrong I understand people gotta make a living but I dont remember akinator having a premium thing or well anything like that,No,None
"Wow ! What a app it knowns everything , but the problem is loading in screen when we open i have network to load it but those use this in rural areas they cant even open . So please change that ð",No,None
"It used to be fun, but now every time you have a 'rare' charecter you need to watch an ad, which sometimes doesnt work",Yes,Humor
"Great app, though you have to watch an ad before each guess, which kinda sucks. Other than that, prepare to be amazed on how he easily reads ur minds ð",No,None
This thing is terrible at guessing characters now unless its a super popular one. I remember this thing used to be insanely good. Idk what happened. Also the ads sucks.,Yes,Irony
"It was a fun game until the game just came right at me and said ""You have already been caught for irregular games. You do not have joker anymore. I must penalize you in the ranking."" WHY IS THIS HAPPENING PLZ FIX IT >:(",Yes,Humor
The best way to use akinator without ads is turn off your internet connection if does not work try to install in on happy mod.happy mod it is not available in the app Store but you can download it in Google as well.but according to the game is amazingly awesome how is he looking at us or he will read our Mind very underrated app I have ever used in my life.nice game,Yes,Humor
"Bro,stop using ads cuz I always encounter some ads that is black screen and I always out of experience,this is so annoying,fix the ads bug",No,None
It asks you bunch of questions and you have to figure them out it's funny they don't get your character but sometimes it is fun if they do too it's just my character two times only one time wrong have fun on yours ð,Yes,Humor
"It ain't fun like it used to be. I remember playing this on the Xbox 360 webrowser. Man those were the days. Now it's all about ads and oh no, you don't wanna forget these coins! I hate games like that. And I hate the way they changed the game. Almost everytime I want him to guess I gotta watch a ad cuz it's ""rare"". Ya sure. Keep thinking that buddy.",Yes,Humor
"Great, amazing app. It actually reads my mind, but sometimes it fails. You have to fix some bugs though",Yes,Flattery
Started out fun until there were more and more ads to see the Akinators guess. Now I can watch the ad 8 times and it still won't let my see the character. At this point you just answer questions to see ads till you give up and repeat the cycle till you decide to uninstall. You would think a an app that has been around for almost 10 years wouldn't have bugs like that.,Yes,Humor
"I think this is just like the best game I've experienced so far, and I really just liked the idea of there being a genie which I was a bit curious about. Though there once was a tiny lag which I'm not sure was my Internet or the game itself and it was when it kept on asking me the same question over and over again. Really enjoyed it:) Try it outâï¸",No,None
"I really like it! me and my bff was so shocked about this game we love this like so much! But, this is the problem i kinda hate it when im done with the first answer and it has an ad and when the ad is done my whole screen is just black and i have to restart again but its fine with me i love this game!!!â¤â¤â¤",No,None
"Sometimes it works fine, Most of times when they guessed a rare character it gives me an option to watch an ad to see the character or else I won't have an award, And when it's 2 times clicking it, The third time won't work and you have to restart the app and start all over again",No,None
"Would be great except for the fact that anytime I think of a rare character I have to watch an ad to see them. Which wouldn't be a problem if it actually doesn't, but I'll watch like 2 or 3 ads and it still won't work! Please fix this",No,None
"I don't often throw five stars out but the game of 20 questions is that good. The ability of the computer to guess right with what sometimes seems to be silly questions, to me is still entertaining. I've stumped it at first guess once so far but I have not stumped it completely ....yet.",No,None
"Almost every character I try is counted as a ""rare"" character. I have to watch an ad to see if Akinator even guessed correctly, which isn't a problem until I watch the ad and the guess is still locked.",No,None
"A very fun game! You think of a character, show/movie, object, or animal, and the Akinator tries to think of it. Most of the time you think of a standard thing, but sometimes you think of a good one and get a ""rare"" medal! Other times you think of something Akinator doesn't know, it asks what the name of it is or what it's called, asks for a discription, and it sends it to them! Again, it's really fun, and I recommend it if you like people to guess what you're thinking!",Yes,Humor
This app is really cool it's definitely than not the coolest app I've had on my phone but you should download it if I could rate out of 10 I would probably give it a 7 out of 10,No,None
"Prematurely guesses far too often, and even more often, it completely ignores the answers you give it. Considering whether or not you get a reward based off if their ai guesses correctly the first time, they should at least ask more questions and actually consider the answers you give them. It's happened so many times where it'll ask me if my character is from a specific game, I answer ""no"", and then maybe 4 questions later it'll guess a character that's from that game and I get penalized for it",No,None
"It was fun and all but i really like it if they just add an option of games they already have objects,movies and tvshows,characters, and there's no games hope they add it",Yes,Humor
"I love this game, but it is VERY suspicious. Like if I say who I am gonna guess aloud it knows a lot quicker and it asked my country and instantly got my pet. I find it odd, I love the game but it's doss raise my suspicions.",No,None
"Mindblowing. This app got it 100% right. Well, not quite 100%. It has gotten quite a few wrong. Quite a few. It's impressive enough. When it gets it right, it does so with so few questions. How it does so I don't know. I think it uses a dichotomous key system and a quantum computer. Amazing.",Yes,Flattery
"It's fun but I hate how even though it has so much evidence and knows what you though of it says ""you though of nothing!"" So I have to re do the entire stupid thing to get my character, which wasn't worth it to tell me I'm ""standard""",Yes,Humor
Akinator is a cool app but whenever I guess a rare character it either wants you to watch an ad or pay for a premium subscription. I don't have any money so I try to watch the video and it won't let me. It's like it's purposely trying to get me to pay and it's not cool at all you putting a rare character behind and ad or pay wall.,No,None
"Whenever you guess a rare character it tells you to watch an ad, no matter how many ads you watch it just goes back to the screen telling you to watch an ad to reveal the answer",No,None
"Good. Most things I try to think of they can guess. But one they cannot guess. Super fun and interesting though, My all 5 stars. Tnx.",Yes,Humor
This game is fun and it's good he can really say to me who is it wow download itðð it's super fun very much but the annoying part is the ads! But it's so good thank you â¤â¤,Yes,Humor
amazing this app works like a charm! but the problem is sometimes it laggs for me i appriciate this bug is fixed but overall great performent!,Yes,Flattery
"Amazing game, too many ads. Also, I rarely get to see my rare character because it just keeps replaying the ads. Please get this fixed. I'll change my review after.",Yes,Flattery
"If there's option for 0 stars, it would be 0, what's the point of playing when half of time is spent watching stupid ads, shameful.",No,None
"It bothers me when it says I have a rare character and I can either watch a video or upgrade to see a rare character but I can't choose either option. I can only choose ""no thanks""",No,None
The only complaint i have is when I'm somewhere quest and i have my phone on silent and the volume off. This app still plays the music at a high volume. Its the only app on my phone that does it.,No,None
Pretty fun I have to say I like the idea to make a game of you guessing a carecter a thing and other stuff and a person trying to guess it.,Yes,Humor
This game is very nice it manages to guess anyone I think of I qould recommend it to people to try It is a great way to pass the time and saves me from boredom,No,None
"Got trapped in an ad loop and wasn't able to see if he guess correctly. It also completely ignores answers to questions already asked, I said no to three questions about my character being in porn/a porn star, and even then it'll guess so early before it's even had enough time to work out who you character is.",No,None
"Sometimes the app ignores that you watched the ad and you need to watch another. Also it makes you watch ad to view your rare character but then tells you to try better next time as it was not first guess. What is there to try better at? Akinator failed to guess, he should try better! Game is good but the ads frequency is silly...",No,None
Does what it's meant to do with all the quirks of an AI that learns from people being honest and other people trolling. Nothing exceptional but it's definitely pretty good.,No,None
I like the game but sometimes he did not get the things that right but I really like it. And is it good to have black skin and of course we cannot say that this is one of the things that I didn't like but everything else I loved everything,No,None
Having trouble using the video option to get rare person reward. If you could tell us who it guessed without reward for free and get reward through video or payment you would probably get more users.,No,None
Tired of adds For after every play there's a add Sometimes when it shows we have choose rare charector it shows watch video after watching it shows nothing,No,None
I give it 3 stars cause it forces u to upgrade for some answers n it gives out awards based off of what? If I answer honestly and it takes him multiple guesses obviously it's a rare find and should be rewarded for basically stumping him. Other than that I am in awe at computer technology.,No,None
"Amazing game! ð It gets what I'm thinking of easily and quick, and not many ads!",Yes,Flattery
The application I can not write a good or bad comment on it because the application does not open and keeps downloading and downloading and downloading to no avail......,No,None
Fun but sometimes won't let you confirm what your rare answers were even after watching the adds. I watched several adds to find out what he had guessed and finally had to relent and click on 'no thanks' it just starts the round again and I have no idea what's been guessed...,Yes,Humor
The game just doesn't open for me it is just left on the loading screen please fix this glitch,No,None
Thsi app is really good i love it sm!!!!!! They've guess some characters correct so it would make me happy and excited!,No,None
"Used to love messing around on this app but now it's not even worthwhile. If you get a rarer character it ask you to watch a video or buy premium, which would normally be fine. The video does not work and doesn't unlock the character.",No,None
"This game is pretty fun, I play it in my free time when I'm bored, it guesses really well. My only reason on why I rated the whole game overall a 3 star is because there's WAYY too much ads, it's like every 2-5 mins there's an ad depends on how fast Akinator guessed your character or whatever, if he's done guessing, there will be an ad that will pop-up and so on. Please reduce the ads, it's too much and ruins the whole game experience, you already have so much money from those ads ð­",Yes,Humor
I love this app it is a quick time passer and it can guess almost anything you are thinking of.,No,None
"it is great. but it needs to add one 3 more things. Youtubers, Celebertes, and tiktokers. But I like it how it is.",No,None
"This app was fun but, de probblem is that sometimes it was lagging so, i'm sorry if its just the wi-fi .",Yes,Humor
Overall a good app. But it sometimes lag when I choose an option in the game,No,None
"Really good, I've done it about 45 times, and every time it gets it right, it's really fun if you're bored.",Yes,Humor
It's really amazing and it says the correct character. I was soo shocked ð²,Yes,Flattery
"Okay so when I was surprised about how many this app was guessing, and I tried to do myself even though I'm not famous ð. When I described to the app about me the guess was, Your reflection! That's so cool how it guesses You. â¤ï¸âð¥â¤ï¸âð¥",No,None
"I really like how accurate this game is, what blows my mind is that it's free. I f I could give it a 10 then I would. â­â­â­â­â­â­â­â­â­â­",No,None
Really cool time killer and great and fun game overall i really love this because its so entertaining and fun to play thank you,Yes,Humor

i couldn't even answer my questions because every time it would glitch and take me back to the home page SO ANNOYING!,No,None
Great game but it guesses too fast like i chose caption marvel and it guessed it in like 1 minute,No,None
"The game is kinda scary in all honesty, If I ever say my character out loud, it almost guesses it emedetly.",No,None
Gud and it's actually a challenge to beat the game. Keep it up guys ðð¾ð,No,None
"It keeps saying technical error occurred, fix this please",No,None
Bought the premium then kept getting penalized when it couldn't guess,No,None
Can't believe how smart it is. To much ads tho. But it's worth it,Yes,Irony
This is cool the only thing is it has a bunch of ads,No,None
It's very fun I can play for hours but the problem it doesn't open quickly ð,Yes,Humor
I like this app! Everything was great but maybe for the theme we could add a little more.,No,None
This app is really good especially to pass time I love it but all i have to say is that everytime i get a rare person you either have to buy or watch ads to continue to answer questions other then that the game is absoutly amazing and i wouldnt have this game if it wasnt for tiktok thats my review no other problems for me,Yes,Flattery
"I enjoy the game, but I've paid for premium at least twice and yet keep getting prompted to watch videos or buy premium on order to reveal answers. Total rip-off.",No,None
I have to pay just because I choose rare characters.....I understand having to see ads but paying to see my character doesn't sound right,No,None
Alot of ads and even when watch it doesn't imply reward Worst app,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"This app is pretty fun to play . Sometimes this will do more than just guessing , it will completely get into the point you wanted so easy , and some times it's just very very close to guess the character but with two or one more question , it'll ruin all of it's guesses . it would be much more enjoyable if you just fix this guessing problem and advance its characters list .",Yes,Humor
"This what happens if the game become famous, the developer will add more anoying ads and add loading screen that will take 5mins to finish, every press theres a loading screen, i cant use the app properly because of the loading screen and the ads. Please fix the loading screen",No,None
Nice but too many ads and it also asks really sus questions nowadays,No,None
"Tries to ask as few questions as possible which is really annoying for lesser known characters, spelling mistakes, broken leaderboards, ads everywhere, EXTRA LONG ADS WHEN YOU'VE GUESSED ""A RARE CHARACTER"" (and then after sitting there for a minute you find out that you've already guessed it years ago so you don't get anything for it!) I tried to relive the game again after a year or so, but can't get past the 6million ads in 2 minutes. Having to watch a video for a rare character is ridiculous.",No,None
This is a good game ð but it background music is bad please make it good but l am not saying that this game is not good it is good but the background music ð¼ makes it bad so please check this game right now and thank you .,No,None
"OK, I'M TIRED OF IT SAYING, ""ThIs ChArAcHtEr Is RaRe, PlS wAtCh Ad :)"". It's not the idea of it itself, it's the fact it's acting as if I did not watch the ad, and I typically end up watching 7-9 IN TOTAL PER ""RARE CHARACTER"". THIS IS SUPER ANNOYING, AND USUALLY DOESN'T EVEN GIVE ME GOOD THINGS FOR DOING SO. PLEASE FIX THIS!",No,None
"Used to love this app but now you have to watch an ad if you picked a ""premium character"". Seriously? First off, I haven't even confirmed that the ""premium character"" it's guessing is the same one I chose... And then I got an ad that was impossible to exit and never got to see if it even guessed right. It's a shame to see what was once a great app turn into this garbage to earn money. There are other ways to monetize (skins, etc.).",No,None
"It's a fun app but the ads spoil it. They're already intrusive and long, but most characters I choose are 'rare' there are more ads than game at this point. Completely unnecessary and greedy. It was really fun but has been rendered unplayable by the sheer quantity of long, unskippable, boring ads. Unless you're looking for a visual catalogue of apps to download, this is not for you",Yes,Humor
This is like reading my mind. he can think of anything! very impressive app!,No,None
It actually is correct sometimes Have to give it a little bit more detail and know a lot about that person,No,None
I think it is honestly pretty interesting. I like how you can choose any character you want fictional or non-fictional.,No,None
"Logic is non-existent, I had in mind a certain character, akinator showed it to me alright and then straight away accused me of cheating, stealing all my rating. How is it cheating if he got it right ffs? Just perfect. Together with numerous ads everywhere, almost after every play, that was the last drop. Uninstall. Never again. Don't lose your time.",No,None
"It's a fun app and all, but the ads get to be a little much and I think that it's unfair that some characters are premium exclusive. That and the amount of errors and crashes you have to push through to try and use it is downright tedious. Good concept, but it definitely needs improving",Yes,Humor
"Fun app, my kids are impressed and I enjoy being mind blown with them ",Yes,Humor
It's a foul app.it can't show our charecter/face/item/pet.its a froude app,No,None
It's really fun coming up with an obscure character from media and seeing it start to close in on it throughout all the questions.,Yes,Humor

"Its a great game but I have 2 issues, one, aki awards should be givin depending on how long it takes to guess the character, 2, WHY DO YOU MAKE ME WATCH AN ADD SOMETIMES JUST TO SEE WHAT CHARACTER I MADE HIM GUESS, ITS SO DUMB, PLEASE STOP THIS",No,None
After playing for a while it started hurting my head like after he was actually looking to my brain through my camera on my phone and then it really hurt my head and then I was basically out the whole entire day but yeah so I wouldn't get it if I could wait a zero I would,No,None
"the game is really great I just hate how I can't see the results whenever there's a rare character I get, I don't want the badge, I want the results.",No,None
This game is good and all but in my opinion I think it can hear you because whenevr you go to answer a question it knows who your charecter is easily and there is no other possible way that it can get your charecter unless it listens to you if you say it out loud it gets it but if you dont it takes a while,No,None
Super cool and surprisingly it can find who your guessing!,No,None
My daughter is so happy with this app she is trying new characters even if she does not know him or her existedððð,No,None

it's very accurate and I tried failing it but it didn't. I'm really impressed but it's creepy in a good way,No,None
"This game is pretty fun, but sometimes it's pretty annoying when they ask me if it's a girl, then they ask me if it's a boy. I also get a problem where the game gets stuck and kicks me out for no reason. When he guesses my answer, he says that I put it randomly. It's not that hard to even guess who it even it is. They also make me watch two ads for coins, but ended up getting nothing. I think it's more fun if you fix this, but overall, it's still a pretty great game. I hope you fix this soon.",Yes,Humor

"This game is great, the genie Akinator which is a AI trying to guess a thing by q&a makes it a fun thing but problem is that it has some mtx on this app but not the website and there's certain giltches but overall, a great game",Yes,Humor
"Like 3 or 4 years ago it was a very fun app. Bu today, it's not. When the character akinator thinking is counted as rare, you have to watch a 30 sec ad just to reveal that character (and a game usually takes 2 minutes) and even after that, that guess may turn out to be wrong, after it correctly guesses your pick, whoops, another ad. And the akinator used to be ""smarter"". Nowadays if it can't get close to your pick, it just asks the same questions you answered over and over again.",Yes,Humor
Imagine waiting 5 minutes and still at the loading screen.Unlike any other games i've downloadit didn't even take 1 minutes to loadð,No,None
"Non stop ads after every question and even when you want to go to the main menu. It only has answers to the most obvious characters and movies. If you try a difficult one, it says you're thinking of a rare character/movie and forces you to pay to access. If you don't, it just doesn't consider it to be complete and reverts to a new question.",No,None
It's scary how fast it guesses even the most obscure characters.,No,None
My Granddaughter really likes this app.She asks all the time to play so I think it's pretty good.It keeps her interested.,No,None

"Pretty fun. There are ads, but it's not ridiculous.",Yes,Humor
Really fascinating and a bit creepy because it knows what you're exactly thinking about.,No,None
"Garbage. Instead of making the app feel interesting by guessing your character like the good old days, now it is focusing on you answering questions until it finally lands, and gets 3-4 answers wrong when you do that. In the mean time if you think of a rare character it makes you watch an ad or pay some money to see if it got your character right after a lot of failures. Not as good as the good old web version by far.",No,None
"Complete scam. You have to pay to check if it guessed correctly. And the ""restore purchases"" button doesn't even work, so good luck getting what you paid for, or a refund, if you reinstall the game.",Yes,Humor

"Whilst it is entertaining when it correctly guesses an obscure character with a few seemingly vague question choices, most of the time the same irrelevant questions are asked over and over again. Often I find that just as the questions start narrowing towards to right path it will take a complete 180 degrees and start presenting options that were clearly eliminated earlier on.",No,None
I Give It 3 stars as it's good and it guesses what I think but I think you should design the menu for mobile players because it doesn't really look good,No,None
This app is great and it's so fun to use on friends and see there minds get blown.,Yes,Humor
"Okay so I downloaded this app a while ago and I very rarely rate apps at all but I wanted to for this. Now this app has a very nice concept, I like it, but it could have been executed ALOT better. Now it's not like I don't like the game in general its just that from personal experience I find that almost all the characters that would get you higher level aki awards are locked behind a paywall. There is too many ads and Â£3.99 seems overpriced. I'm uninstalling for the lackluster experience.",No,None

"I couldn't. The very first time I installed the game it took me around an hour. What's the worst part? It didn't even work. This game is busted and you should fix your it ASAP. I don't hate this game, in fact I really wanted to play it - it's disappointing very much.",Yes,Self-Deprecation

"Fun app, but not when basic functions dont work. I can't watch ads too get coins or rare characters because they never load.",Yes,Humor
Yeah it's fun expect the fact that you have to watch ads when you get a rare character and the ads won't work most of the time,Yes,Humor
When i downloaded it i was not sure if its real but when i tried it i was speechless omggg i was thinking abt camilo from encanto ð­ð­ and i kept getting shocked how everything was right i love itttt but its creepy and cool at the same TIME!!!!!!ðððð,No,None

"I like the game, it's fun, but I keep getting rare characters or objects, then it tells me to watch a video, which I do, but after the video is done it takes me back to the rare creature/movie/object/character page where it asks me to watch an ad. This is really annoying,",Yes,Humor
I like the game but the ads are way too many,No,None
"Great experience. Had lots of fun with it. :) I made my friends believe that I am a wizard. ð Edit: I really had a great time, but now third time in a row, that I guess the daily chsllenges, and I don't get any award for it. It shows that I completed all 5 tasks but I don't get the award, or I guess the correct person but it stays hidden and it says that it's a standard guess. These bugs get really annoying after a while. I'll change my review once these are settled.",Yes,Humor
These is a best app first time I try on techno gamerz it works second time I try on shinchan it works again I like this app,No,None
It is very amazing game which which question I ask all the answer it gives any answers all the famous person names also I like the game very much,Yes,Flattery
"Very good game, I like the incentive for thinking of a rare character",No,None
Such a fun game but the ads are outrageous the straight worst I have seen. Sometimes you have to watch 2 ads just to be able to see what the genie guessed. Also in order to remove the ads it's $4 wayyy too much for just ad removal. $1 for ad removal is reasonable. Look I get they have to make money but it really is making this great game bad. The game itself is very fun though.,Yes,Humor
Fun game but I hate the ads,Yes,Humor
"It is a good game and has served me well,i rate it 5stars because it always guesses correctly",No,None
It is good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is because everytime I get a vip character for some reaso. I cannot see the ad i don't know why. Please fix it,No,None
It is an amazing experience and if he doesn't know the answer you can put in every thing obout him/her and rilly fun ð and he knows ð almost every character!,Yes,Humor
"Waaaaay too many ads! No matter how good an app is if it plays this much it is literally unplayable. A 30 second ad is played after pretty much every guess, which only takes 30ish seconds, so you end up watching ads more than you actually play the damn game",No,None
"Game was good, and I actually liked it. It's just so much ads and it's annoying. And I hate having ads on games. But it was still very good after I played it like you said yes like everything that were really I am thinking of and like it's could change like characters like some outfits hats like anything if you earn like some coins to buy them. You know like I already said like if you gave it like four stars and I just don't like that and because it's very annoying and sometimes just the lags.",No,None
"Let this die. Akinator used to be fun, now it can only guess popular characters only. You get prompted to watch ads at every opportunity. If you guess lesser known characters he won't find them(I tried to guess some 300k YouTubers and it didn't). They claim that your character is ""rare"" to make you watch an ad of a definitely not rare character only to be wrong so you have to keep playing. Or the ""rare"" character is correct and it gives you like a standard award... Boy don't get me started ...",Yes,Humor
"I watched an ad to uncover the ""rare character"" and NOTHING HAPPENED! it just gave me the options to watch another ad, by no ads, or try another character. This has happened 4 times so far in the first hour of downloading this game",No,None
So far the game is good but why I can't watch the ads?,No,None
It's pretty cool and a little scary that it can read your mind.,No,None
"Love this.. but what's with having to watch 2 ads now before you reveal who has been guessed. You used to throw ads in once every 10 or 12 guesses, then an ad every guess.. now 2 ads every guess.. and sometimes gets it wrong, or says it's a character that's been guessed before.. yet forces you to still go through the whole ads, makes the game quite tedious to play having to watch ads before every guess is revealed, and even more tedious that your now forcing 2 ads on people for every guess.",No,None
Because I am a BTS army and my bias is taehyung I find taehyung and I finds very bad picture for taehyung please Set a good picture,No,None
This app is really cool and it can guess your character with 99.8% accuracy and it has every character you can think of,No,None
"I have no idea how the Akinator is so amazingly accurate, but it guesses exactly what I'm thinking every time! Great game for when you are bored, would totally recommend.",Yes,Flattery
"Filled with ads and paywalls. The option to continue via watching a video (instead of paying) glitches at least 80% of the time, leading to your session ending. Charging $7 for a half-decent machine learning game is brazen; $1.99 would be more fair.",No,None
Cool little app but the ads are intolerable. There is no way in hell I'm paying to get rid of them either so going to uninstall. Thanks for the 5mins.,No,None
"Amazing game! I love how it knows even the most uncommon characters, and if it doesn't know you can add more! Plus there are new categories for animals, places, and objects. I also like the leaderboard and trying to collect many rare badges for my favorite characters! Great job! :)",Yes,Flattery
Had a lot of fun but I already have a guess how he knows my character he first base on the popular characters then eleminate the non similar answers but eventually he'll figure it out,Yes,Humor
"It almost always has ads, I just feel like I want to delete this. and also, it is not even close to what I am thinking, it really only does it sometimes.",No,None
It is very very best. it guess every thing that you have in ur mind.,No,None
It's ok could use help in certain places an more fun games in it,Yes,Humor
"this game was amazing I try to lose him but he didn,t lose",Yes,Flattery
"He Literally Knows Every Type Of Movie/TV Show ðº. The Thing i don't like is there are no games theme,because there are many games for Akinator to guess. Thats all I wanted to say about this app But still its excellent",Yes,Flattery
"This app is amazing! I was thinking of an almost impossible character (Mr. Peabody) and with a few trials and errors from the genie, finally figured it out. The AI in this app is amazing; the way it does trial and error questions really help it guess the character you're thinking of. The best part about this app, is that it has the category of basically any and every character ever, which is what really helps it guess the character you were thinking of. Definitely worth downloading!",Yes,Flattery
This game is cool for the most part but then annoying and stupid because of the ads and it just bumbs you down on the leader board so what's the point even,No,None
great game but lot of ads,No,None
Impossible to enjoy for free. Ads don't work most of the time. They play but never let you see the character you thought of.,No,None
"It's a very good game,it's just that it takes a little long time to load the next level and question sometimes,after all it's a good game! Idk why ppl say it's a very bad game",No,None
"A nice little time killer! But I am really annoyed with the ""VIP characters"" thing. I appreciate the fact it isn't cluttered with ads, but I haven't been able to play certain characters because of it. I wanted to play Gazorpazorpfield and Jaguar from Rick and Morty, and the screen popped up saying ""this is a VIP character"". I had no problem watching a short ad, but I repeatedly tried pressing the ad button and it just kinda froze. But if you ignore that, it's actually a pretty fun game :)",Yes,Humor
This app is just pure fun especially with a group of friends. The real mystery is how it figures out your character or other catagory,Yes,Humor
I am really impressed with this game because at first I thought it was just a lie but when I downloaded it I was mind blown because it actually knew what I was thinking about so I definitely recommend you download this game right now because it's awesome.,Yes,Humor
Very great app it got all of my then correct just need to give right information. I would have given it 5 star if it didn't show this many adds. Truly ming blowing!,No,None
I really like this app as it is a really good mind reading app but I have given it only 2 stars because after the first game when I tried to play again it always shows two options try again and cancel. Whenever I click any option it again shows the same options. Its quite irritating and also it takes hours to open and so I reinstalled it. But still facing the same problem. It is a really good game. I would request to please fix this problem.,No,None
It's so much fun and I love when he guesses ot and I get up and dream with surprise,Yes,Humor
It didn't know no majority of the characters that I was describing when it did have an answer it just just said something about a golden reward and to watch an ad or pay something and then when you click on no thanks it gives you an ad every single time you try to click off it gives you an a d I used to play this game ages ago come back to it and it's ad riddled over all it is a terrible waste of time and in some cases money. hope this game gets better in another 2 years!!!!!!,Yes,Irony
"only one reason why i only rate 2 star,cuz when i try to guess him ""nics orense"" a filipina famous tiktoker, the akinator app is crash*ð¤ð«ð ððªâ",No,None
It funny and cool but to many ads,Yes,Humor
What's with the fullscreen unskippable ads?,No,None
This app is still definitely fun the HUGE problem is the amount of ads like Jesus you used to get 1 ad after guessing around 5 characters but you can't go a single guess without getting 2 ads. Like I get it you need money but damn it's kinda hard to play the game when theres more ad time then play time.,Yes,Humor
"While I've been a fan of Akinator since the web version appeared, this is a scam, at the very least. You are forced to buy the premium or get ads that don't so anything and restart the questions instead of rare character reward. Then when you click""no thanks"" it back up to 1st question, And if you go back to main menu it runs you 2-3 ads. Horrible money grab. Shame it occured on a fun app like Akinator. Damn shame indeed.",Yes,Humor
In this app nothing is displayed on the screen . lt's just not loading more than half. It is not a network problem because I tried it with wi -fi and on 2 other devices also laptop and mobile .Please make sure that when again I play this game it is a great app and I rate it 5 stars instead of one . Thanks,No,None
I like it but the game the problem is that the game has to much ads and it takes up a lot of my time,No,None
"I think it's a great game, Just WAY too many adds, and I hate it when you guess a rare character, but u have to watch an add to see if he guessed correctly, and then the add doesn't work. Other than that, good game!",No,None
"It's a great game with accurate results, but the whole ""rare character"" thing is bothersome. Most of the time, the ads don't unlock the results and you watched an ad for no reason. Other than that, I like it.",No,None
"Not sure if it's a bug or they game made it this way so that it wants us to pay for their premium, but when I find a rare object, it doesn't let me watch a video to unlock it. Obviously the button to purchase the premium but not the option to watch an ad.",No,None
"It's a fairly simple and straightforward app. It's 20 questions with a computer that has an internet connection. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there is no ""Video Game"" option. They have people, places, movies, etc. But, I feel that adding an option for video games would really up the value of the game and would open to a wider audience.",No,None
"It repeats questions or change the form of question,many times.So you have 30 questions and 10 of them are same question,if he doesn't guess you character at the end of 30th question he'll randomly guess,even when you try to continue,it's useless because you don't get the prize.What's the point of rare character,sometimes you don't even get a option to watch video to unlocked it.",No,None
Its a fun game but the traps system doesnt really work. It makes sense but will get you for the wrong things more often than not. I've had all my points taken by it for saying yes to characters i was genuinely thinking of. Its not a good feature and needs to be improved.,Yes,Humor
"A few things: One, the pictures dont load. Its not that big of a deal, but it would be nice to see them. Two, The ads are out of hand. There are way too many, and everytime I click a button, theres and ad. Used to be fun, but kinda got bad.",Yes,Humor
"I found a ""rare"" character, watched ten (10) ads in a row, and still wasn't able to unlock the character. If this is a bug, please fix it. If it's purposeful, shame on the developer team.",No,None
The app is good but whenever I get a rare object it says 'rare object found' and gives 3 options to see the object and get the reward. 1st one is watch an ad 2nd one is to buy premium 3rd one is to skip I always choose the first one but it doesn't work so everytime I have to skip and I dont get the rewards. Fix your app!!,No,None
"Totally Unplayable. Downloaded the game and wasnt even able to play it once. It was just stuck on the loading screen no matter what i did. Please fix this, i remember playing this ages ago and it was so fun but because of this issue i am very dissapointed",Yes,Humor
"The fact that this wonderful creation nearly guess the character I was thinking of is absolutely terrifying, I figured it was impossible, but he got pretty close. I'm giving this app four stars because I'm not really used to the changes, though they're something I can get used to. Minus that, great app.",No,None
"I've played this game before a few years ago and it was one of my favourite games, but now it's just terrible. I unistalled it as soon as I downloaded it. I can not believe the amount of time it took to load and don't get me started on the adds there is wayyy too many ads this game turned into a mess.",Yes,Irony
"It's a good app except when there's a 'rare' character. You either have to pay, or watch an ad for no reason. I know that most of the people getting this app is probably not wanting to compete with other people. The ads get old after a while, I'm just trying to do something when I'm bored. :/",No,None
"Ridiculous that it won't show you the ""rare"" character without watching a video. The really ""funny"" part of it is that you can watch the video and it still not show you said ""rare"" character. I'm sure the devs are aware of this ""issue"", but it gets people to watch adds over and over trying to get the character to show.. means more money for them. Their player base is high enough, so they don't care about the angry people because the ""loyal"" ones will buy into it. I'm very ""happy"" with this app",Yes,Humor
"To Start I love this game, I'm kinda addicted to it at the moment. I love the being mind blown by the fact it knows who your thinking about the first 20 time you use it .... Then it becomes a different game NOW your trying to beat the game by thinking of characters the system doesn't have just so you can add a character that you really enjoy into the game so it can blow other people's mind when they try it for the first time ....... Just wish there was a little more I could do with coin in game.",No,None
"I give this game, 1 star because this game has to many ads, when your done getting your answer, the ads come back to back. And for me when I turn off my wifi, it just sents me out of the game with a error message. Please don't download this game. It will just waste your time.",No,None
Speechless..it guessed my mind.Great work..but how..It's wonderful app..,No,None
I love this game it does not have that much adds just because I just started to play it a few seconds earlier but I still like the game!ð,No,None
Really good game! Its fun and interesting! But one problem. Whenever i do a rare idea i click see a video it does not work. And it forces me to buy a 3.99 potion for no adds and it really gets me mad because i wanna get a acomplishment done but you know its boring now because i have to pay to see my anser whatev,Yes,Humor
The reason only four stars is when akinator thinks Im thinking about a rare character then I have to see an ad BUT WHAT IF HE IS WRONG. Thank you for your time â²ï¸ reading this comment.,No,None

"I've been having a great time with this app, but after trying to get the genie to guess the negativatron from little big planet 2, I was penalised even though it guessed it correctly. It was labeled as an ""irregular"" game, but as far as I can tell there is no way to see what falls under this. If there was a way to see them so that we can avoid this mistake in the future would be great. Besides that issue, the game is a blast.",No,None
"At its best, its 20 questions. Its neat the way it guesses obscure things, but its not at all worth dealing with ""premium characters"" you have to pay to access and tiktok ads every 90 seconds. It was fun when it a dumb little browser game, but as an app it is worse in every way.",Yes,Humor
It's a good game on play store I love ð this game you have to try. This game is also famous on YouTube,No,None
"It's pretty darn cool. Ads, yea sure, but it's not like I'm playing this for more than 2 to 4 guesses and the ad is like 5 seconds after each guess so it's really not bad. I'm actually sitting in amazement for like 10 seconds and trying to figure out someone else for it to guess. I thought of vegita, Aladin, harley quin, dr.manhatin and Alexander the great. It got every single one right. I think they deserve the revenue from a 5 second ad. It's cool to me. I'd recommend",No,None
I used to play this game when i was younger then i deleted it. A couple of years later i forgot all about this game then i was scrolling through tiktok and someone was playing this game and taking a video so i went to google store and downloaded it,No,None

I mean, it was fun at first, and I had many, many medals, but then, I accidentally cheated, and he ""caught"" me, bumped me from 11th place to 4,321th place, and every time I played a character, it gave me wrong ones to see if I would ""cheat"" again, and every time i say, ""no"" it says there's a technical error and to come back later. I had to delete the app, and redownload it, but of course I didn't have any of my medals, or my money. Also, a whooooooole lotta adds.",Yes,Humor
"Ummm it's good but low-key kinda scary, IT KNOWS FROM JUST A FEW QUESTIONS AND IT SCARES ME /Gen",No,None
"It's great and worked pretty much like it used to on the website when I played with it a long time ago, but this app is pretty much garbage. Constant errors on startup and reinstalling just gives new errors every single time. I even spent 4 bucks on removing ads n' stuff just for the app to become completely unusable. If I can't even get the chance to use the app, I'd rather just have the $4 back.",No,None
"Game is great! Akinator is extremely smart. However, there is an absurd amount of ads.",No,None
"The game is nice. It guesses the character you're describing- or at least tries to. The game, however, requires lots of ads in order to truly experience the game. The ads will some times not even load, leaving you to ditch your potentially amazing character.

I love this game. This game is amazing and is music is also amazing.,Yes,Flattery
"He's good at guessing he just can't figure out YouTubers. He guessed the first 4 but then branched off. Pretty fun, besides the fact he picks up on what you say. When you say to your friend what you're thinking of, Akinator picks up on it and gets it in no time. He cannot really guess lochness monster either. 3 stars.",Yes,Humor
This app is amazing I really like it the idea of reading your mind is cool but I just wish it would be more simple,Yes,Flattery

"Basically just ""Pay us or you can't play"" Thought it was a free app i shouldn't not be able to see the results because you want me to pay, adds are one thing those are needed for a free game but forcing us to buy premium is nothing short of greed At the end of most answers the watch video add doesnt work it only says buy premium.",No,None
I was playing this game to kill time. The game however kept glinting out and crashes I wish that I could rate negative stars.,No,None
I love the game and all but there are to many ADDS,No,None
"good game. But ad is the problem. When I finish a level, it shows ads. But this is not the problem. The problem is, I can't close the ad. I need to restart the app. And it's soo annoying.",No,None
I really like this game although the akinator ALWAYS reads my mind but I still enjoy it a lot,No,None
Very cool game! But I wish it didn't have ads ð lol. Anyways keep up the great work!,No,None
It is a good game but When I play on my chrom book a advert shows and you cant play you have to uninstall the app then reinstall so you can play agin,No,None
"very good game, but i liked it more before it had in app purchases, and you could see any answer without watching ads or buying a membership. if there were money restrictions in the challenges, customisation or tounaments, okay, but at least let me play the raw version of it without restrictions like these!",No,None
"It's a good way to sink time and I like it, my only issue is the amount of ads. Right after he guesses, and I choose to play again, an ad pops up...every time. I feel like it should only be restricted to when you guess a rare character and watch an ad to see the answer.",No,None
"I first downloaded akinator when I get my first smartphone in 2010 and it's still great. but who has this terrible idea of showing ads to see the guessed person now? oftenly it's wrong and become waste of time. you can show ads here and everywhere but forcing us to watch ads to see the guessed person, whether the answer is right or wrong, is annoying",Yes,Irony
It's kind of like a fun Google.My sister and I are just completely blown away with all of the accurate answers. It even gets annoying because I try really hard to think about an idea and it keeps guessing it!ð About 1 out of every 10 times it can't guess. It is a really fun game that can get your mind thinking and pass time.,Yes,Humor
"Its a good game! Tests your mind, and guesses correctly alot, although sometimes I think it contains a speaker. Whenever I said my word aloud, it always guesses it correctly. This is weird, and I could be wrong. Until the guesses are able to change my mind, it'll be a 5 star!",No,None
My daughter loves this app! She says It's so fun to play when you are bored! And it's extremely entertaining. Even I enjoyed it!,Yes,Humor
It is nice and it actually gets my guessings correctly i hope there a future updates better than this!,No,None
"The game itself is okay, but sometimes I have found some unknown issues (both v8.2.1 free ver & v8.2.0 paid ver) First Issue: The whole ""Add Magic"" section sometime diseappeared randomly.

Can't open the video to check rare characters. My ranking is never updated.,No,None
"It boasts guessing any character, but often doesn't guess characters I try. The system of getting rewards for having him guess characters, but not for thinking of a character he couldn't guess is a bit strange, and the limits to the experience like ads before seeing which character he guessed are a bit annoying, as those ads could have been placed elsewhere, but all-in-all it's a unique kind of game and it is fun despite its flaws.",Yes,Irony
Its enjoyable but 1 thing that i want to be added is add more themes like a videogame or something like that and still its still fun to play,Yes,Humor

I've thrown some seriously obscure characters at him, and he still gets them right (within a level of reason). Definitely deserves a 5/5.",Yes,Flattery
This app suprised me because when I thought of a character it simply got all of them correct. The genie in Akinator is so smart that sometimes even if I pick something wrong it still gets the character correct. But sometimes it doesn't get it correct so I just continue till the time the genje gets it correct!,No,None

Love so much it can read any mind go check it out most likely to be a better game than ever so much,No,None
"This game can be fun. It is impressive that the programming allows it to be accurate so often. It's quick, simple, and fun. However, sometimes when reviewing the answers I have given to some of the questions, it can say I have answered ""wrong"" when I know I haven't. It would be nice if there was a way to change answers, even if you have to submit your request to someone else, with some sort of proof.",Yes,Humor
"While i really enjoy the concept nearly every character it guesses is a ""vip"" and i ""just have to watch an ad"" or whatever. i dont mind.. but when i watch too many ads and they become unavailable, it's really unsatisfying to not be able to see what he guessed. Other than that, I really like Akinator, its pretty cool.",No,None

it's ok but I can't really play it takes forever to load.,No,None
"Pretty cool app, 9/10 times i was thinking of someone, it got it right",No,None
this is a very smart app and its read our mind by answering questions. i like this app,No,None
It was a great app some years ago but not it is totally filled with ads. Anytime you find a rare character it shows you a 30sec ad. If you don't watch the ad it just not shows you the character. Really worst... The game is also not good as it should be... True maximum question limit should be 20 questions. But sometimes for rare characters it asks 40 to 50 questions and also didn't tell the right one after watching a 30sec ad.,Yes,Self-Deprecation
It's a great app/game and I totally liked playing around with it but it doesn't have a music theme if the creator can add that I'll give 5 stars but for the rest it's a great app/game,No,None

Then, when it guesses wrong YOU lose points ð¤·ââï¸ when i got frustrated and started doing stupid easy ones like jason, i got flagged for cheating. Need better questioning format and cheat detection algorithm. Looking forward to seeing improvements though!",No,None
"The app doesn't recognize a lot of characters and you get absolutely nothing for beating him. Also, despite choosing all the correct options, he picks the wrong character and you lose your points because you have to get it on his first guess. It also is stupid since it doesn't remember your answers and will often ask contradictory questions and repeat a lot of questions. Why would my character be blonde when I already told you he has black hair? So stupid.",No,None
This game reads your mind mascara seriously read your mind it's crazy Quarry games more but it's good game a guest of Sonic.EXE and Mario,No,None
I love this game so much but it should ask more questions.,No,None
Although the ads are really excessive this is by far one of the most impressive and addicting apps I've ever had. The answers are literally 98% accurate most of the time. Just mindblowing. If i honestly had one critique it would definitely be to just to tone down the ads.,No,None
"All things are very good. He answered my 99.8% thinkings. He is very intelligent. But only for one issue I gave 4 stars that it contains tooooooo many ads. Sometimes when I finished and going to ask again, the ads are coming tooooooo much. Its very annoying. Please remove ads for free! Then I will give you 5 stars.",No,None
"He truly can read my mind, i know him since when i was kid",No,None
New update makes it crash after add,No,None
"So the app has some neat features the website doesn't, but it also plays ads. 30 second fullscreen ads at that, and when the length of an average game is so short it really bogs down the experience, but can be removed for $3.99 under the settings. If you genuinely want the best Akinator experience you could get this app and buy the Premium Potion to remove rhe ads, but even then the extra features conpared to the website are somewhat minimal, limited to leaderboards and daily challanges.",No,None
"I love this game Cuz it can read minds and I really Wanted this game, thanks for making it!",No,None
"I used to mess around with the old Akinator flash game on web browsers. It was a pretty good time waster. I found the app years ago, and feel like playing it every now and then. I always enjoy giving it characters it somehow guesses. I feel like it's been rather ruined with the unnecessary VIP system, and videos don't always work. Of course it's a free game, and they need to make money, and the ad-less option should be that source. Just don't get greedy like every other app developer lately.",No,None
"Way too many ads. It's like the game punishes you for being correct and getting a rare character. Get a rare answer? Hooray! As a winner you get the next thirty seconds of your life watching an advertisement. Congrats! Got penalized for saying Akinator got the EXACT character I was thinking of and got dropped to the bottom of the list after ranking around 29th. I constantly got asked for my location. Overall, terrible experience and an hour of my life wasted :/. The website is way better.",Yes,Irony
"I remember discovering Akinator a bunch of years back and it worked amazingly, Akinator never got anything wrong but now it sucks. Now it fills up to a quarter of the bar, asks me stupid questions with no relevance and the bar gets filled right up, but if I find a ""rare"" character I have to watch an ad!? And the worst part is that most of the time it's not the character I'm thinking of and personally I think silver-award medal characters shouldn't be ""rare"". Silver-awards have no value.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
I love this app! He guesses really good and nearly guessing all of my characters but sometimes it gliches and his eyes turn red but only for 10 seconds. I think this game is really good I thought of a meme and he actually guessed it right! You can change the way he looks and change his hat. Download now!,No,None
Great app.... When it works. I constantly have to uninstall and reinstall it since it will tell me that there isn't a network connection when I'm connected to wifi. I'll turn the wifi off and on and it will still say no connection. Only way to get it to work is to uninstall and reinstall and it's getting to the point where I will leave it uninstall if each time I want to use it I have to uninstall it.,No,None
"I feel like this game has really changed for the worst since the last time i got it, theres so much loading screen and i cant complete one single game due to the amount of loading, like it takes 10 seconds or more to load a follow up question, i got sick of it and deleted it 2 minutes after opening the app, i think itll be better for me to stick to my PC's web to play this again, i hope that one didnt change much",Yes,Self-Deprecation
I love this app so much everytime me and my sister play this and choose a character in our minds and it would always get it correct but the most annoying part about this app is that when we forgot the character and we do it again and it says we already done it. Its really annoying that we forget the character we done it would always get on my nerves! But great job making this app!!!!!!! ;3,No,None
"i like the game for the most part, but my only complaint is the cheat catchers. The cheat catchers will take up the first try, so if you say yes, it'll say you cheated, but if you say no and he guesses it the second time, it won't give you the medal. Also, he won't narrow down the characters correctly and will repeatedly guess the wrong characters. The only time that you'll be able to say which character you're thinking of is when you search for your character. It's really annoying.",No,None
"I downloaded the app because there was a limit to how many times I could play online, which I think is ridiculous, but whatever. In the app, whenever you get a ""special character"" it forces you to watch an ad to see your character. I think this is pointless because I shouldn't have to watch an ad for the game to tell me it guessed wrong, and I was unable to watch the ad, anyway. It wouldn't play.",No,None
"this app is the worst data collector I have ever seen. Apart from people saying the ""rare"" thingy, akinator uses your Google search history and you voice detection to give an answer. That's why it works more precisely on mobiles than PC's with no mics. And Most importantly before uninstalling, disable the app permissions and clear app data. Thank you for your time",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"It's fun, but I'm really tired of it straight up ignoring my previous answers. Numerous times in a row I have selected that the character is from a certain series and he guesses a character from another series. Repeat questions are also quite frequent.",Yes,Humor
"This game is so cool. It knows what your thinking, and its great to play with friends. It would be cool if they made a guessing game separtly, for idems. Of corse, theres pros and cons, and many of them. The games takes forever to load, maybe over ten minutes for me, hard to play the game when you expect it to never load. Amazing game, just hard to wait forever for the loading. Comeshals they are fine, not so dificult like other games. I would get this if I were you, just the loading is bad.",Yes,Flattery
"great idea but very annoying. too much ads, every other character is a ""premium character "". also, its guessing game is not that strong when it comes to less popular characters. it asks same questions 3-4 times and asks contradictory stuff. e.g. i answer the character is over 40. then it asks me like 3 times whether my character is under 21.",No,None
"Glitchy. Makes you watch adds just to see if the character the ai guessed is correct and those adds do not always load. The awards it gives don't make sense, you only get the award if the ai gets your character first guess then tells you to try harder if it didn't (even if it says you answered all questions correct for it to guess right).",No,None
"Keeps getting stuck on the screen where you can watch a video (advert) or pay for no ads to get your result. I watch a video and it goes back to that page. I watch another and the same happens. Also frustrating that if it doesn't guess your character you don't score! It was the game that lost, why don't I score?! Last thing I that it doesn't know most of the characters I chose. So hard to get an obscure one it knows and gets right.",No,None
"Akinator is not that good. It wouldn't be too complicated today to find out famous identities with many questions. Yet, he repeats questions and fails more than expected. The application won't work. It shows a splash screen with music and a progress bar, then the bar stops before finishing... and that's all. How complex would an application like this be? I do enjoy using Akinator, and I even keep the application just in case my problem gets fixed. I'd recommend it, with all the caveats though.",No,None
"Pretty good for what the app is. It almost always correctly guesses the character you think of, even ones that may be considered obscure. The interface is kind of clunky but the app makes up for with it's interesting concept.",No,None
"Well It's a good app but, Whenever I get a rare character I get to choose 3 options like 1.see the video 2. Buy Premium 3. No thanks. But I can't able to select First option. After I chose No thanks and to back home they show ad. The problem is if we ever get rare character we need to buy premium to get it, But if they didn't know the guess character then we need to tell them inorder to perfect their system. Oh I almost forgot, If they guess the char after 2 attempt they won't give any points.",No,None
"I used to love the game but i have recently come back to it to see that almost everything is a ""rare character"" in an attempt to make me pay for premium potion or watch an ad every time i want to know what he got.. nothing but ads now no longer enjoy the game because of this and will be getting rid of it..sorry:(",No,None
"the app is ugly to look at; the ads are unbearable (popping up every time they guess someone); for some reason there are ""premium characters"" that you need to either pay for or watch a video which is ridiculous; the progress bar can sometimes stop going up for no reason and stay stuck; it feels less effective than the akinator on browser by repeating the same questions over and over again and useless questions; and the worst of all are the daily challenges that are utter garbage.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Great game/app, have used it on and off for years, but now the have a reward system. So the more obscure the person the better award you get, BUT the obscure people (or maybe adult based people) are hidden behind a VIP wall. So you either watch a video every time or you pay $7. I've had p0rn actors, drag race contenders and secondary GTA characters behind the wall.",No,None
Almost a pretty good app. Pretty accurate but the scoring is flawed. If YOU get the answer I lose.. I lose.. ME.. why the hell should I get no points if I beat you? If it takes you 3 tries to guess the right answer then I picked something good. And then it'll say something stupid like this is a platinum level super rare character that was last guessed 1 year 5 months and 3 days ago but we can't give you anything cause it took us 2 tries... basically your app sucks. Get it together,No,None
"Used to be good, but now just jumps to conclusions and gives contradictory questions. The fact that you lose an award because the app jumps to conclusions is really dumb. It also asks you to try harder to make it guess on the first try when it's not your fault. On top of all this, it's riddled with ads.",No,None
"Sometimes doesn't let you see his guess unless you buy the app! I have loved this app for years and recently reinstalled it on my phone. I got to the end of the questions where he guesses the character and I got a message saying it was a""VIP"" character and I have to buy the app to see his guess?? That totally killed it for me. Sorry but I'll be uninstalling this app and won't be back. It's a shame since this used to be one of the coolest apps ever made.",No,None
"The point of the game is to get Akinator to guess characters other people haven't guessed for a long time but when you do that it's a ""rare character"" and makes you watch a long ad to get the award for it. It also seems like EVERY character is a ""rare character"" which is even more infuriating. This game used to be good but it looks like I've had enough and am finally uninstalling.",No,None
"Game was fun until the app stopped working. Now it loads halfway and quits. I then get a message that a technical error has occurred. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but I get the same result. I am using a Samsung Note9.",Yes,Humor
"Very disappointing. The game crashed, and has serious trouble loading anything. It asks the same questions during the same round. It's also very dumb that it has to get your character the first time to get points. It needs to ask a better array of questions.",No,None
"Instead of just playing the game they added a point system & micro transactions. If you make him guess certain characters, they are marked as rare and you have to watch an add to see if he guessed right. If he guesses wrong, it is your loss and not his. Either he gets it right, or you get it wrong. This seems like a quick cash grab, but I must give my respects to the developers. They got over 100M people to download this game, including me. I hope they are spending wisely",No,None
"This game is amazing! It usally guesses the person first try and you can get creative with the people and thing you chosse!! The only bad part is that if you get a ""rare"" item or he has to guess 2 or more times you have to pay or watch a vidoe if you want to see what he guessed. :(",Yes,Flattery
"The game was generally fun and I enjoyed it. I didn't have too many problems with the VIP characters as everyone else was saying. But then the Cheat Award screwed it up. I got the Cheat Award five times in a row when Akinator had the right character and I lost my leaderboard rank. I even did a couple characters I'd gotten before the Cheat string began as a test and he got them wrong. I gave up. If you could tone down the Cheat system, I might consider redownloading.",Yes,Humor
"This was fun for a bit. Then I started thinking of obscure characters. I played for several minutes just for the app to say, ""Oh, you're thinking of a rare character! You can't play anymore unless you pay!"" Then your game just ends. I'm not paying four bucks to see a ""rare"" character. I WOULD have paid money for a game that doesn't use such insulting tactics to get at my money, though. Just charge up front if I can't play the game without paying anyway! Uninstalled!",Yes,Humor
The game is relly cool but the only probloms i have is when I go to play the game the vloume turns all the way up when my vloume is on low but other then that the game is cool. PRO tip: when you see a lot of ads then go to air plane mode ive tried it and all of the ads went away but you have to wach mabey 2 or 3 ads.,No,None
"It's amazing! It was great until I keep getting this ad about as free if you pay or watch a video and I always get it while he is about to guess who my character is! If I press no thanks, he restarts. Pls fix this bug.",Yes,Flattery
"The majority of time it took to download was impossible. (About 6 hours) I didn't even get a chance to download it! And I had full bars! For my love of kpop, I was really looking forward to a kpop guessing, thrilling game adventure. Overall, I don't think it was my phone or service wrong, but the game. I will be giving one star. ððâ¹ð²ð¡ð",No,None
"I'm mega sad about how this turned out. I used to love this game, and I bought the upgrade in the free version a while back. On my new device, it says I restored my purchase and it didn't. I tried the button in settings several times too. Plus, it won't let me watch the ad or buy the upgrade if I get a rare character, so I never get any points! Since it won't restore my purchase and I can't play like, any characters, I'm gonna uninstall for now. (;-;)",No,None
"After hearing about the variety of detailed character choices from all different genres, I went on and gave Akinator the ultimate test on all the hardest and most minor characters I knew from all different sources, and one after another, he guessed them all in only a dozen simple questions. Consider me amazed. extremely fun to play around with, highly suggested.",Yes,Humor
"Cool game. Has lots of characters but AI is bad at guessing the more obscure ones, even if it exists in its database. Sometimes has unskippable ads, sometimes the player needs to watch an ad to see Akinator's guess (or the game just resets).",No,None
"It's a really fun concept but if you try to guess someone and it's a so called ""VIP character"", you have to pay real money for it and the ""Watch a video button to reveal te VIP character"" doesn't work for me. The worst of all is that when you say ""No, thank you"", you have to restart over again...",Yes,Humor
"It is fun, there is a paywall or watch an ad which isnt a huge deal for some characters. My biggest complaint is the fact in punishes you if the genie/app gets it wrong. Like why am I being punished and excluded from more points because the all knowing guessed wrong. Makes ZERO sense. Usually I just say yes if they dont get it so I get those points and try again.",Yes,Humor
"This game used to be fun but the monetization has made it completely pointless since it will only ask you a handful of questions before it gives up unless you pay an obscene amount of money. Unless you think of the most popular characters ever, it won't guess your character. I remember playing this in a browser years ago and it was able to guess the most ridiculously obscure things. Now it can't even figure out main bad guys in popular franchises before it gives up and asks you for money.",Yes,Humor
"This is really fun,either when you reach your character or not. I don't rate â5 because I think there is a glitch.I added a character but I can't reach them however many times I try,and they don't even appear on lists.Except for that this is a great app",Yes,Humor
"Someone should really look into scams like these and deal with them. The game requires you to pay for a VIP membership in order to reveal the majority of the characters. Paying for a side feature is one thing, but to interlope with the ACTUAL PLAYING is just wrong. Pay to play. I'm sure you'll get rich from this. Pathetic.",No,None
"It guesses way before it has enough information, making it impossible to get to the character you intend. Also, it asks repeat questions, insisting you made a mistake, then guessing wrong based on assuming you made a mistake. Another problem is the point system. If you outsmart Akinator with an answer that fits all the questions, why don't you get more points? It makes no sense to get less points by being good at the game.",No,None
"Please fix your game. There was this one movie where I had limited knowledge on, and when Akinator actually guesses the movie I was thinking about, it calls me out for cheating! Just after getting a Black Aki Award! This made me go from 2nd place to 10th because of this silly mechanic. I can see from the reviews that a few android users also experience this problem (such as me). I had deleted the game because of this, it's really annoying if you're just trying to have fun.",Yes,Humor
I keep guessing the right things but a character that I have never seen before pops up not even related to the questions. I click ok because if u don't u won't get the reward. But it says I violated which was ok I guess at first but five times in a row weird characters pop up and I'm starting to lose points now,No,None
the version on web browser is better. VIP character thing is really dumb and the ads sometimes force me out of the game and to a random app. I'm all for supporting these people but the app is just garbage. play it in a browser like chrome or firefox for a better experience.,No,None
"The cheating detector system is plain stupid. When the Genie can't guess your character correctly after MULTIPLE attempts and giving the Genie all possible clues, everyone's TEMPTED to say yes to the ""wrong"" character that the Genie persists to select everytime (this way you can at least achieve a medal and get compensated for your time). Except the stupid game detects you as a cheater and deducts points. Either update your stupid database or remove this useless detector system.",No,None
"This is a very fun app. If you don't care about you're coins and the leaderboard, it is one of the best. The only problem of the app is ads. But, still it's not a big problem because the ads show up very rarely and very less compared to other apps and games.",Yes,Humor
"This game used to be fun, but now I hate it because it added ""rare characters"" that make you watch an ad to see what he guessed. And sometimes the ""rare characters"" aren't even right, so it's just wasting your time. I do not recommend getting this game.",Yes,Humor
Nice app you can try. This is beyond imagination and creativity. You can think of any fictional or real life person and just answer the interesting question. I dont like that others are giving it single star because of ads but i haven't faced this issue a lot. Its working perfectly.,No,None
"It would be great if it actually would show me the characters, because every single character that I think turns out to be a VIP character, and then its suppose that could either become a VIP member or watch an ad video for see your character, but this is actually fake, because the second option doesn't work, I press the button and it does nothing. This sucks and totally ruined my expierence whit this app.",No,None
"The most updated version of this app causes my device to lock up, despite owning a Galaxy S10 Plus. Also, just lol, now it asks for location permissions, looks like the developer is trying to mine your location data. Everyone deny that permission, it's completely unnecessary for a video game.",No,None
"Meh. I suppose it's a cool little novelty, but it ""has technical difficulties"" often. It like to say I'm thinking or a rare character to make me watch an ad, but is then unable to guess the character. What? Also, it really doesn't make sense to me that winning requires it to guess my character on the first try where in my mind ""winning"" would be stumping the game. Also, it will ask the same questions over and over or ask if it's a girl then ask if it's a boy.",No,None
"Too many ads! Its often accurate but not always in the first attempt besides if it can't guess it,it increases nd increases the questions nd repeat it...and if its a rare character we can't see the character for tht we've to watch vid but the video doesn't even open.",No,None
"Remove the VIP function. It's almost impossible to play when half of the guesses are locked behind the VIP screen. I get it, you want to make money from this. But here's how you should do it: have COSMETIC microtransactions for Akinator's outfits and backgrounds. Leave the random character trivia alone. Until then I will not rate it higher than a single star.",Yes,Humor
It is very own thing what it is this is a game about guessing characters from real life movies and video games and if your character is not here you can Add one and then the team will add it in and it actually does it that's awesome this game is awesome they added 3 categories objects films and animals pretty cool but i prefer classic however sometimes the music is gone can you fix that ignoring that it is a full five stars,Yes,Humor
"This app is continuously testing you for ""supposed"" cheating and most of the times it says you are cheating, you are actually clicking on the right character, and then it takes you to the bottom of the ranking and you lose all your points. This game is not fun anymore. Don't waste your time.",Yes,Humor
"This game is good. it's a fun way to kill time while at work or school. But the VIP Character things is so bad. I get it, you need some money. I understand completely. what I don't get is why there seems to be a limit on the number of ads you can watch. Isn't that counter intuitive? *Edit* You need to fix the ""Trap"" mechanics. There have been numerous time where he guessed exactly who I was thinking of, but then said I cheated. it has now dropped my rank from ~110 to ~7500.",Yes,Humor
This app actually works I'm impressed. Other people should really try it because he always figures out what is in your mind. But I really don't like that there are ads. I really hate ads. I even delete other apps on my phone because of them.,No,None
Personal I love this game. But there is one problem. See I play on a chromebook and when the ads pop up you cant exit out of it. So every time there's an ad I have to exit out of the app. other wise the game is pretty great.,No,None
"It is really a nice game but it is very irritating that after it knows your character you get an add saying ""you need to buy VIP sothat you have access to all the characters."" I understand that you need to make money but honestly, do you actually think that people want to spend money on a simple game like this. Please fix this because the WORST thing in a game is getting a message like that. This could be an amazing app but can you use your brain hen making an app? And you have plenty of ads on it aswel, a person should think that you make enough money. This is ridiculous and ABSOLUTELY KNOWONE likes an amazing game ruined by such annoying things. Thank you and I hope that this will be fixed soon enough. ð¡ð¤¬",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"It's one creepy, it either looks through your camera or is listening, whenever we said what who, ect. I was thinking of, it got it in two seconds, two, I kept clicking to not allow it to have my location and to not ask again yet still it popped up. I get it, it might be cool. But for safety do NOT download. Wonder why its ristricted on your chromebook for school? I just answered your question. I don't trust this you shouldn't either.",No,None
"Nothing like being rewarded for finding a rare character with an ad (in which he doesn't even guess the right character half the time anyway). I don't mind ads, but that just seems so backwards that it's kind of infuriating. Also, Akinator doesn't congratulate you anymore when he doesn't know your character. It just goes back to the menu. Talk about a sore loser; he can't even look at you in the eye when you win.",No,None
Fun to play but without paying you cant see if it correctly guessed most of the answers. It has an option for watching an ad but it never works and you can mostly not see if it is correct or not.,Yes,Humor
"I paid for the premium version with no ads. When I continued getting ads, I contacted the support email and still have recieved no info on why I'm still getting ads. Don't download if you have a problem with apps stealing your money.",No,None
"You just found a VIP review. To know my thoughts and discover my rating, become a VIP member and gain unlimited access to all reviews and no ads. I give it two stars because it isn't nearly as bad as as it was just a few months ago, where almost every single character was locked behind that utterly insulting ""VIP"" thing. This is only a small step in the right direction, as ""VIP characters"" shouldn't exist at all, but they've at least made some vague effort to fix their mistakes.",No,None
"Reward system is completely ass backwards, rewards are handed out based on how well the program works - I'm not sure the developers have quite grasped the concept of incentives. Anyway, this app suffers the same flaws that it always has, ambiguous questions and poor grammar make it far to easy for the underlying algorithm to get confused.",No,None
"Really fun until they try and force you to pay money. Like I'm willing to watch an ad to help support the app but then they won't let me watch the ad. So when you find a locked character or whatever you have the option to pay money for no ads or watch an ad to unlock it. No problem with that, but now they're not letting me watch the ads so my only other option is pay money or leave the game. obviously I left the game because I'm not about to pay money for a game that wants to force you to pay",Yes,Humor
"It was okay at first, but then after the questions it started telling me I found a rare character and told me I had to watch an ad every. Single. Time. And they weren't rare either, they were all found over 30k+ times and every 30 seconds or so.",No,None
I could not stand all the ads!!! There were so many! Not mention that I had to be a vip member to see so many more things. There was also this extreamly wierd thing that only allowed me to get a medal if Akinator guessed something in the first try instead of saying it was wrong and him guessing it again. I was not happy at all with my experience AT ALL!!!!,No,None
"Well, first of all rare characters need and ad to access them, i knoe its a free app but there are already ads after each round, and then I just found out that the akinator mist gues on the first try to get an award, i mean you should be rewarded to challenge the akinator, i wasnt the one to get the guess wrong.",No,None
"Questions need some refining. It will ask questions like ""does your character come from ancient Greece?"" - yes ""has your character been dead for more than 100 years?"" - yes ""is your character from the portal series?"" ""Was your character a first round pick?"" Why would those second two questions even show up if it's already narrowed it down to ancient Greece? Not a major complaint, just something I find annoying and pointless",No,None
"This is an excellent app indeed!!! But it requires a high internet connection or else it keeps on buffering....so if you guys can fix this problem, I will be really impressed that you really looked upon the problem.",Yes,Flattery
"The 30 second unskipable ads and look ng surveys that make you feel like you're applying for a mortgage are major bummers. This game used to be and, still could be fun if not for these. Uninstalling after only one day. It says it ""contains ads"". It should say, ""there really is a game here hidden amongst all of these ads. No, really!""",Yes,Humor
"pointless game if half the content is behind a pay wall. ads are fine, some kind of premium feature is fine, but making a bunch of the answers hidden is so stupid and made me uninstall in 3 minutes. don't bother with the app, just use the website!",No,None
"Love playing this game but the paradigm is so backwards. I had to upgrade to see if the genie guessed right. And you don't get the (empty, meaningless) awards if he doesn't guess on the first try. The game would be cooler if the contestant was rewarded for stumping the genie.",No,None
"The VIP thing is annoying but otherwise it's doing as it's attended to I think. I only use it when I have friends over or when I'm bored. Ads are ads, part of the Free Games, people can deal with it.",No,None
"I'm surprised by how well made this is and how accurate it is most of the time. My only problem is, and I quote ""VIP characters"". what even is the quota for one!? and I hit ""watch ad"" and I cant close the add! many people say they cant even close the ads and we never see the guess unless we pay FOUR BUCKS FOR A GUESSING GAME! A dollar is a little bit more understandable but FOUR?! FOR A GUESS! No thank you once they fix the freaken ads or better yet, get rid of VIP characters, I'll rate higher.",No,None
"Personally, I don't like that you either have to watch an add or pay to see some characters, when on PC all of it's free. Still an okay game, though I recommend it on PC.",No,None
"Jeez I understand that you guys need money but an ad for every time you played and then you have to pay to see a rare character? Isn't the point of the game to let him guess characters? There's way too many ads and when it gets fun, you don't even get to see it",Yes,Humor
"I used to love this game on my browser, but the main appeal has always been seeing how easily it can find the answer. This VIP character thing removes that as an appeal since there is no way to know if it's even close to correct without paying money or dealing with ads. If you're going to do something like that I feel like it would be better to only have a paid VIP version, rather than earn so much ill will from your old fans.",No,None
Play this game with my kids it is so much fun,Yes,Humor
"The game is fun, and very creative, but now it tries to shove monetization down our throats by making 80% of the characters ""VIP"" which cannot be viewed to see if the guess was even right without paying. It says that you can also watch an ad to view the character, but it doesn't work. I would rather it had annoying pop-ups then this bs. Seriously, cant you just make a game enjoyable? Monetization is fine, but don't restrict the gameplay.",Yes,Humor
"It used to be good, but now it's terrible. The money hungry developers made it so in all the characters I got, 90% of them required the pro version, or to watch an add to see the result. Additionally, the anti cheat not is terrible, falsely accusing me of cheating, and after thinking of Scooby doo, and getting four results that are made by the anti cheat not, I finally get Scooby doo and the bot says I'm cheating, dropping my rank from the mid 30s to the 1000s.",Yes,Irony
Most of things are there in this but I tried to search nima dendongpa it does not exist,No,None
"Don't know much of the game, I play sometimes but there are quite a few ads. There were a few steps for me to get an account for this game to accept the higher awards, I decided to just not make an account, kinda frustrating.",No,None
"I really love the app, it really works as described, the only down side is that it takes very long to load and it has some unskippable ads, besides that this is a great app I recommend to everyone.",No,None
"Lost all I had, could have been from an update can't restore the purchase I've made over a year ago. Not only that but the app is broken. Tried multiple times and now this so-called genie can't ever figure out who or what I'm thinking about. Not to mention he keeps asking the wrong questions making it nearly impossible to get him to guess it right. What a waste of time.",No,None
I love this app it's good for playing on the road,No,None
"I disliked how you add more options yet cant seem to handle it, probably and probably not, even makes you seem like a poor man's akinator. Took like 36+ questions to get to the person i was thinking of, and still have the guts to repeatedly shill ""guy who randomly answers"".. Never had this problem with web akinator.. And ofcourse wants as much data as possible, pass.",No,None
"This was really neat until the app started trying to sell me the premium version. just because he can't guess who I am talking about doesn't mean I'm going to pay money just for him to get it wrong. long story short, it's fun for a while. but once his programming gets confused and he doesn't know the answer, that's when the app claims your character is ""premium"".",Yes,Humor
"when i downloaded the app i played my first game it was fun! but the second round i saw a pop-up that said ""allow akinator to track your devices location?"" and that scared me, so i rushed to deleat the app. in my opinion it is NOT ok to be able to track someones location. i recomend staying away from this app, just in case.",Yes,Humor
"If you guess a ""rare"" character, you have to pay to see who it is? That's ridiculous. The game is basically you either guess someone common and it wins, or it has no idea who you're thinking of. That's not fun at all.",Yes,Humor
"This game was actually good he guessed characters like gumball or maxwell or Twilight or Om-Nom. And you'd get ""aki awards"" (which I personally dont need). But there are a few glitches. Like how they guess characters that aren't child appropriate when on child mode BUT they guess characters that ARE child appropriate when OFF child mode. If you guess a rare character, you need to pay?! This isn't really that big of an issue but it doesn't seem right. Overall it's a good game but can be better.",No,None
"A great program, but there is an error when you know the character, it shows unused ads and the screen becomes black and you can not play on it until after half an hour",No,None
"A really nice person to play with. But, he sometimes confuse movies tv shows, but I agree its hard to guess, cause there's thousands of movies and tv shows, otherwise, its a very awesome app!!!...",Yes,Humor
"This used to be fun and cool to play but is ruined by the fact that almost every character the game guesses is a VIP character and then you either have to pay up or wait almost a minute just to see what character the game guessed. What happened to old fashioned just give me the damn answer? Be warned, game eats your cellular data up real quick and you can blame the ads for it. What a big shame this ""game"" turned into. Greed ruined this app. Absolutely cannot recommend this app anymore.",Yes,Humor
So amazing it's like he is actually reading minds,Yes,Flattery
"I used to love this game. But this VIP access needed to see certain characters is annoying. You have the option to pay $1.99 or view a video, but the videos are NEVER available. It's very frustrating.",No,None
"Every time I watch an ad to get the rare character it won't show, fix this bug.",No,None
"Fun when you're bored, problem is when you find a potential rare VIP it freezes unless you get lucky, kind of a shame, unless you pay money for no adds, which i hope isnt the intention on the developers side, judging by the other reviews it's not just a problem on my end, please fix this, perhaps then I'll give this a 5 star",Yes,Humor
it guesses whoever you think of 95% correctly at som time... and yess mostly it guesses whoever or whatever you think of.... its a smart app :) i L it sm :),No,None
"Great game, blows mine and my kids minds every time. We have had fun trying to outsmart him, and it's close to impossible to do! We have found out it is very amusing to watch him be outsmarted. It's a wonderful time killer and just great fun. Would DEFINITELY recommend. ð",Yes,Humor
Garbage ads the website made me install this to get more plays. I think its ridiculous that i need to watch a video to get my result when theres already tons of ads after every result anyways. Trash app. Just a waste of my time if youre going to make me pay to see something or watch a 15 minute long video. Go to hell,Yes,Self-Deprecation
This game was very good but now most of the time when it finally guesses my character I need to watch a video because of VIP. You are money hungry. Why should people buy something on a guessing game just to unlock more characters? Find another way to get money without it affecting the main gameplay.,No,None
wowwwww so good it always read my mind,No,None
I really enjoyed it. Great job,No,None
"This is a fun game and I do enjoy it however, I've beaten the game so many times. There have been many times just over the past hour where I have had to type in the name of my character and I had to add a new one in too. I'm disappointed that there is no reward for beating the game so if you can add some kind of reward for that, it will be a 5 star from me.",Yes,Humor

"Wasn't usefulness. It wanted to know my location, so please be careful when downloading this app. You can just go online and play Akinator. I tried to see if he got the character right, and a ad popped up, and would not close. I tried again, and I hit a ""Vip character"" I wasn't able to see if he got it right. Used to be free, now wants you to not only pay $3.99 for the Vip version, but like I said, you can play it online for free. Plz don't download, waste of time and money.",No,None
"This game makes you think you can get cool awards, but I never ever got a platinum or gold or dark because it's only possible to guess them on the 2nd or 3rd try. The people who are getting those awards are either choosing that he guesses without caring, or cheating and answering the questions in a way that would get them the character using a wiki or something.",No,None
"It can actually read mind!ðð Okay so...it's nice and I guess ads are also not that much as some ppl reviewed ''so many ads'' kinda something. Overall this app is really something on which you would like to waste timeð and not be disappointed.ðð",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"It was fine at first, but now whenever I get a rare character It tells me pock one of these options, and they are see a video to claim prize, and buy subscription. And everytime I tap on see a video, it does nothing. So I can't get my prize. That's why You get 2 stars.ð",No,None
"Love it. However please add an option to see all the characters you've played and suggested, and an option to report an incorrect picture. Also I'd like to be able to add questions for a character I suggest.",No,None
It's a great game but it would be better if you could buy the premium potion using coins or smth but overall very cool game,No,None
"I love it. I just want the Akinator to not use a phone because that's unrealistic and it gives the person away. It reveals that the Akinator is sort of cheating at its own game. Besides that, it's a really awesome game. Just make sure that you fix that because that's the reason why I uninstalled it.",Yes,Humor
"I love this app, I really do, but that ""Cheating Badge"" just ruins everything. I understand it's reason is to prevent cheaters from making the leaderboards, but geez it's unfair. When I was playing, I was going for Beth from Until Dawn, which he got correctly. Unfortunately, when I clicked yes, I was awarded with that stupid cheating ribbon. My rank went from 46 all the way down to the 6326 because of that stupid ribbon. I'd love this game a lot more if that feature was removed, thanks.ð¢",No,None
"I like the game alot but.. Iike i do not think its very good to have certain characters be vip characters so you would have to buy the premium version for the game to be able to get it, and if you dont have money, you have to watch an ad",No,None
It's super fun to play and is 99% accurate I just love it,Yes,Humor
Great app really fun can read your mind but can't what makes it funnier and Akinator is great for any kind of age no adds.,Yes,Humor
Even Though This Game is Really Enjoyable...But at Some Points It has lots of bugs...Like Sometimes Game Dosent even open! Sometimes It just crashes while Playing! Also There are not enough People That i can find in this Game...Like Whenever i tries to find Someone Not very famous....i always Gets the answer of 'A Guy Who Plays Randomly'! Please Fix These! Thank You!,Yes,Humor
Good App Edited As On 22 March 2022: Very good app you can make fun with with your kids and also give you this by turning on Child Mode. Overall Awesome app please make this like web Akinator Because web Aki. Design looks cool,Yes,Humor
A funny experience and he's very accurate! I always play this game whenever i have the time,Yes,Humor
"Can guess only most known characters, even if the character is a little less known it's not able to guess it the first time. On the contrary it gives (useless) rewards only for guessing it correctly the first time, that too based on how (less) frequently it has been guessed. I'm seeing a serious conflict of qualities here. Worth only 1 star.",No,None
Its so funny and i really like it,Yes,Humor
It's great it's fun too it guesses right sometimes and wring sometimes but overall it's good,Yes,Humor
Amazing game I will never delete this game it is amazing,Yes,Flattery
"Keeps crashing mid-game, has this annoying validity check even if you paid for ads to go away.",No,None
It's so weird that he can pick 1 out of 100 charater and guess the right one. It very fun,Yes,Humor
"I would of given it a 5 but after this new update I hate it. Everytime I try to guess something it will be like ""is it this very obvious detail of a character that I should know"" yes ""oh this is a completely other character"" whatever I'll just say yeah ""excuse me are you cheating you must be stopped!"" It's akinators fault not mine and I have lost all of my points fix it please. There's no reason for this update I don't like having to lose points for this just cuz you can't get it right Fix it!!!",No,None
"Love it so much! I beat him twice, but I experienced a bug where he beat me, and then I pushed record and my game crashed and said I beat him. Please fix. Also, I had an idea for a horoscope mode. You have a button that says horoscope, and then if you click it, it says: Pick a mode. Then you can choose from three modes, which are life, love, and fate. He scans your hand and/or face and tells you about whichever one you picked. I love this app! I do hope that you continue to make this cool game.",No,None
"Ahmad Sheraz review for this is cringy af... Anyway, this is a great app. I've seen a ton of friends using it on Facebook and finally decided to give it a try. The main complaint I have is the fact that there are ""premium characters"" which is absolutely ridiculous. There are plenty of other ways to earn money rather than having the player watch an ad to unlock a character that might not even be the intended character. Fix this.",No,None
"Aside from getting dumb meme entries when you're trying to get an uncommon character this game is incredibly fun! Shame ""rare"" characters need ads now though. Does make it less enjoyable.",Yes,Humor
"This.game.is.awesome. I dont usually give games 4 or 5 stars but this game gets a 4, not a 5 though, sorry but it's so cool to hear when they get your character correct, but it's also kinda creepy and scary, like I wonder how they know... and how they ask the right questions to answer.. its weird... but also, it use to be for everyone, but now it's for teens, I'm ok with that, it's just my younger friends also wanna play but, not properly rated",Yes,Humor
Surprisingly good with famous characters. People you know is wrong a lot. Apparently my daughter is supposed to walk on 4 legs and have fur and not be related to me... weird... wish there was a way to suggest changes to some of the questions. I keep trying to come up with more and more obscure famous people (both real and fictional) and it usually guesses them right.,No,None
"Man it's probably coincidence, or maybe I'm super basic, but I downloaded this app and on the first play it immediately asked 3 questions related and guessed correctly",No,None
"No longer safe for younger kids. We've been playing this game without issue for years when last night it asked if the character appeared in a PORN. So that's a fun conversation I hadn't been planning on having just yet, but here we go! This game is rated T for Teens. Pretty sure anything porn lands in the 18+ range.",Yes,Humor
"It used to be good in my old phone akinator guessed my character correctly, but somehow in my new phone i can't make akinator guessing every single characters correctly even the easiest character , whats wrong? and the questions always same questions again and again . Same os oreo .",No,None
I love this game but i don't like how sometimes it doesn't give you a trophy. I did a movie and it took him 46 questions and it said i needed to give more effort and before it said someone got a black award from a movie that was relesed the same year that my movie was.,No,None
"It is okay overall and the ""badges"" add to the enjoyment. I agree with the fact that the VIP thing is kind of useless honestly and I have a problem with is in order to win any of the badges he has to guess the character on the first try which is kinda stupid as the point of akinator is to beat him in this aspect. Another thing is when he gives up and gives you a list to see if your character is there you get nothing out of it other than a note saying that he will research them in the future.",No,None
Fun to use guess often correctly,Yes,Humor
"Filled to the brim with ads, and does not allow you to play offline. That wouldn't be so bad if the guessing was well programmed. I say the character is blue, and he guesses a very similar character that is red. That is unacceptable for what this app is supposed to be.",No,None
"It encourages you to find platinum characters but it only gives you the score if it's on his first guess. I've found a bunch of platinum characters but, despite me answering everything correctly, he still can't get lots of them. ""Is your character from grease?"" No ""is it Sandy?"" No! I said not grease! If you answer everything correctly and the character is guessed, you should get the points. Not my fault your program isn't good enough to figure it out first try.",No,None
"The game is super unfair! I tryed to make it guess a character, and I forgot an answer so I answered don't know then it gave me the character I was looking for but when I clicked yes it said my play was invalid and I apparently answered randomly. I didn't answer randomly and it was really unfair and I should've gotten those points! Worse yet apparently it'll subtract points from me if I do it again! Please take away this system, or at least add an ""I forget"" answer. until then, I'm leaving.",No,None
"It tricks you into paying 3.99 to unlock a 'vip' character! after answering a bunch of questions, it will sometimes say it has the answer but they are a 'vip' character and to unlock the answer to see if they even got it right you will have to pay. So i go onto my friends phone with the same character in mind and it will immediately guess the character without me having to pay!!",No,None
"it used to be fun, before you began charging money to reveal the character I'm thinking of. That's like playing mario and getting to the flagpole only to find a text box that says ""want to beat the level? pay $3.99 or watch a 1 minute ad!"" It's anti-consumer money grubbing and the devs should be ashamed for being so greedy as to monetize a game of 20 questions.",Yes,Humor
"I used to like Akinator, but the ads are a little too much. Having to watch an ad everytime I find a 'rare character' just so I can get the badge is annoying, and that's if the ad even loads.",No,None
Everyone is complaining about how slow is it when loading but for me it just take 10 or less seconds so 5 stars The game is sooooo fun,Yes,Humor
Ok a lot of ads,No,None
"The game is overall fun, but when I opened up the app sometimes it will say that your connection isn't connected even though you are connected OR, it says that was technical problems. I wish you can make an update and fix it.  ",Yes,Humor
Great app and love to beat it. However quite often I found that a certain answer had been falsely discribed. In a challenge I chose the Ross rifle Mk.3 (a Canadian WW1 rifle) but after Akinator gave up I searched for it and it came up as being built in France. I wish there was a way to change answers but otherwise a great app,No,None
very good app for having fun. I'd 100% recommend if you're bored,Yes,Humor
"Every person I wanted him to guess was a special character so id have to watch a video but there is never a video! So I have to pay money well I guess they have to make a profit somewhere, I uninstalled it hate it! Another thing is if it guesses someone related to you it doesn't give you a akinater trophy e.g gold,silver,standard.",No,None
"Annoying ads, but Akinator really does read your mind.",No,None
That was mind blowing for me. My brother just show me and challenge me to select a character and he will know who is he/she is. That was awesome experience. Good Work Guys! Round of applause for all of you (if thia developed by single person then many congratulations to you). Although the idea is bit old but I saw first time in Android Application.,Yes,Humor
This game is too obvious because he ask too many questions and make like reading mind,No,None

"It is pretty awesome, but it is quite annoying sometimes that you have to watch ad to see who Akinator guessed",Yes,Humor
"There is something wrong with this app, it's inappropriate, changes the language, and also some of the buttons don't work, the withdraw consent, as well as it glitches out. Be careful. Don't install.",No,None
"it is a great, fun and addictive game, however, what really ruins the experience is that whilst I was playing, the game accused me of cheating by randomly clicking things, I was not. I was playing fairly and wanted to know if it had stimpy from the ren and stimpy show, this lowered my rank and took money from me. please can you change/fix this issue",Yes,Humor
This can guess alot and it's not perfect but so are we,No,None
"This game is fabulous, like its just straight-forward. Almost every time you pick something, it goes in his mind, and down to you. The only reason I rate it a 4 because you can't really choose badges and it says ""The last Aki award has been awarded to (random person) 1 hour ago"" when you have got the badge like 3 minutes ago. Anyway thank you for making this smart genie don't know how its smart but have a nice day.",No,None
I like it and all that but the fact that it makes me watch literally 5 ads in just 1 rare character thing is so annoying,No,None
I like it but it takes forever to guess.,No,None
Hmmmm... it's good dont get me wrong and often guesses your ideas correctly. However it's very annoying and frustrating when you watch an add and it tells you your cheating when you just wanna know if you have the right character,No,None
It is late at night and he has guessed every single character right even the most extreme underrated character from an anime that isn't well known. I am scared.,No,None
This game is amazing I just guessed lankybox Justin kroma I love this game so much,Yes,Flattery
Fun great xx for you at picking a random person without akinator knowing,Yes,Humor
Pretty amazing how it gets the right answer way too often. Fun game.,Yes,Humor
"This game has given me so much trouble, I was climbing the ranks on the leader board and I got to top 25 I then went for a old German scientist that I had assumed haven't been guessed for a long time and I was on the final question and it was about my characters origin and it said European and obviously the answer is no but I accidentally clicked yes and that was the game ending question so I couldn't fix it and I had already got a warning because I tried to get a old character that was removed",No,None
I love this app it's a great way to pass time only one thing I recommend is adding a location theme,No,None
"It's a great game.....ð¦¹ââï¸ The only problem with this game is that it takes too much time to download and it would save a lot of trouble and time if you'll could make an update for a faster download.... Other than that ,great game, love it...ð",No,None
"Too many ads, especially after each play what lasts 1 min maybe. And they often don't show characters, because they are ""rare"" lol. All these things doesn't make this game enjoyable.",Yes,Humor
Disappointed Everything was fine until the update.Why do I have to purchase the premium version for getting the aki award of a rare character?,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Used to be a good game, then they added more and more ads. Don't get me wrong, i dont mind that much watching an ad to see my ""rare character"" but now it seems theres a limit to how many i can watch? id rather watch an ad than just not get an answer... makes the game completely not fun",Yes,Humor
"It was fun at first, until I realized that half of the cool options were pay to win. VIP characters are so aggravating that I will probably get rid of this app by the end of the day. Over half of the things I tried were VIP, so this game is pretty much worthless. Waste of time to get exited about something that won't let you play.",Yes,Humor
"Since when did this game become so greedy? I tried playing this on the web but it says there's a limit on how many characters it can guess per day and that I need to download the app, which I did. It always says my character is rare (even tho it guessed it the first time) and I need to watch an ad to be able to see his answer of the ""rare character"". And there's even a limit of how many ads you can watch to see his answer which basically leaves you with the only option of buying the premium ver.",No,None
"Honestly, the algorithm always jump to conclusions, as well as not asking questions enough to make an assumption like, its questions are too random, like it's not even finish asking the hair colors, then suddenly, Akinator would suddenly ask about if it wields a gun or a sword, then it would suddenly jump to a conclusion...",No,None
The answers are interesting... But the Ads are a little annoying!,No,None
"It asked terrafying questions, like ""is your character in a relationship with s*x"" overall the quality is great! Good job!",No,None
"I love Akinator but when I try to add a new question to include in it, it's all messed up and becomes impossible to add a new question.",No,None
"This app is really amazing , it can truly read my minds . I m literally shocked right now ... Just how can a app do this ? Amazing ð",Yes,Flattery
I like it so much! it can really guess your character ð«ð¤ but I didn't guess Eugene from dangerous fellows so i rate it a 4ðð,No,None
I was really amazed when it read my mind correctly 4 times in a row... It worksððð,No,None
It is correct every time mostly it mite not if you say no for something that's a yes but even it just will take longer.,No,None
It is a great game but creepy how he can guess some different characters lol,No,None
"Often got error message, won't change the ratimg before you fixed it",No,None
The game is good but I think not getting a bagde bec he lost and we doesn't make sense and also he asks us questions that will make him know and we must answer,No,None
Its good but I gave it a 3 because the AD's and bugs are quite annoying,No,None
very good app wold recommend this but sometimes it will make you wach a ad be for it guss is it,No,None
He is amazing! He can guess a character from my own mind! It is so mind blowing. Try it for yourself!,Yes,Flattery
"It really guesses everytime the right answer! Amazing app, a must tryð",Yes,Flattery
"Free, fun , good challenge...need I say more?",Yes,Humor
I really like the game but I really want him not to get correct but the game is cool and I wish it was a girl and not a boy though.,No,None
"It's ok, but what is going on with the ""vip character"" thing??? Literally almost every character I've played so far is a ""vip character"" and even if I watch the ad it still might not be the correct character, another thing: the movie one is terrible, I've tried to get one movie for about an hour, would be easier to get if the questions were more relevant like, ""is it based on a myth"" or ""is it based on a legend"" or maybe even ""is it set in the medieval times"" or something like that",Yes,Irony
"Very fascinating app! I have managed to stump it a couple of times with rather obscure characters, but more often it gets the answer correct. Correct. I really like this, and I'm going to keep trying to beat it!",No,None
"MIND = BLOWN! Absolutely beside myself trying to figure out how the freak this app knows exactly what you're thinking of! I think of something totally off the wall, I answer maybe 5 questions and it gets it almost every single time! And if it doesn't, its way too close!",No,None
"Love this game, it Is very fun! I like to guess characters from the movie IT on it. but the down side and why I have it 3 stars is because if you have a ""VIP character"" it will either ask you for money or watch a add, and the adds aren't always available. but besides that, all is well with the game!",Yes,Humor
"I like it but i judt dont ,like it when he gets your charetet but doesnt show it right away because you need to watch an ad",No,None
"Im using a LG stylo4. Not the newest phone, not the oldest. The questions took a long time to load and once the program thought it had the right answer I was told ""you have found a VIP character"" and would only show me the result if I paid 3.99 they ruined this ""game"" by making the website limited to a few times a day. Website said the app would be unlimited but it failed to mention I would have to pay. Very lame, wont be using this again.",No,None
Nice app . Fun to play with nice time pass it guesses whta i am thinking 99 percent of it answers are correct 1 percent its wrong,Yes,Humor
"At forst, the game was very accurate, until i got into less well-known characters. Then it got less accurate. I understood that, until I found out that you had to PAY to figure out if akinator guessed your character correctly for some characters. Why? It makes no sense to pay Â£3.99 just to find out if Akinator guessed your character right. I have no other words for that.",No,None
"This app is so fun that it guess the right thing object animal etc. But sometime it guesses the wrong answer , but that question will be very difficult which I asked so it says the wrong answer. But I'm rating it 4 stars because of ads in every single round it shows the ads if ads will not be there this app is 5ï¸â£ stars",Yes,Humor
"It is really cool but I just hate the ads in there, it's so annoying- good game by the wayð",No,None
Hard to trick him. Pretty fun trying to though. He's good! Lol,Yes,Humor
i enjoy playing this when i get freetime and i love the game a lot!,No,None
"I really enjoyed the game despite the many ads but then after playing for a few months I decided to make an account with my email. Next thing I know, I've lost everything. All I was trying to do was to make sure it SAVED my stuff, instead it deletes it.",No,None
It's a good time waster but the annoying part is that you don't get points if Aki gets it wrong the first time.,No,None
"the game is awesome because he asks questions not even related to the character sometimes and he figures out who it is on the first try, but for some reason, I have to keep uninstalling the game and redownloading it again because it keeps not launching...",Yes,Humor
"The ads do not work so I cannot see the results of a rare character I've searched, but overall the game is cool and it keeps me on my toes when I play. If you could fix this I would greatly appreciate it.",No,None
"Its a pretty fun game. I think it kinda sucks that you need to watch a video ad to see your rare character, but then again i dont think many people would spend money on this game. Also, i dont get why akinator has to guess your character first try to get rewards, i feel like it would be to stump the game you win. I enjoy this game a lot, but sometimes i get invaildated even when it was the character i was thinking of udududhdhxs Would reccommend tho",Yes,Humor
The game actively encourages the player to use obscure things in guessing but the only way for the player to get points is if the bot gets it on their first try... Probably the worst game design choice I've ever seen.,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Can't reveal any of my characters anymore. Take a survey for each and every one unless I pay 4 dollars for premium. Try to do a survey, doesn't work and doesn't allow me to reveal character at all. All of my guessed characters are ""rare"" characters that are hidden behind paywall. You guys are losing money at this point by doing this. I could still be playing the game and looking at the already existent ads, or I could get the stupid ""rare"" character and bot play at all. REMOVE THE FEATURE.",No,None
Nice app. You're able to type in updates on new people that you think about. Ads only pop up when asked. I can't stop playing this game. Also I am able to watch videos instead of paying to see rare characters or themes.,No,None
"Don't be fooled: this game is NOT free. Sure, you can download the game and have him guess some characters for free, but 99% of the time the character you're thinking of is ""rare"" so you have to watch an ad to reveal the character (or pay). The best part is watching the ad to reveal the character doesn't even work half of the time! Once you reveal the character, it's often not the one you were thinking of since Akinator loves to jump to conclusions. You're gonna be watching a lot of ads, buddy.",No,None
"This app used to be good and would actually continue going until it was absolutely certain who I thinking of. Now it seems like it jumps to conclusions before asking the really specific questions that let you know it's close just so it can say you're ""thinking of a rare character"" and shove an ad down your throat and then get it wrong. I don't mind watching ads, but make it quit just guessing when the bar is only half filled before asking the specific questions.",No,None
"Hi!!! I'm here to say that this app is amazing!!! The akinator has not misgotten even one of my characters, I have not yet used the objects version but I can say that the Akinator even got an old French movie I like on the movie version. However, if you are wondering why my rating is lower, it is because, on the animal version on each try I've had I've been called out do apparent cheating. I haven't. And I could have lost points, if I had some in the first place. I will change my review then. :3",Yes,Flattery
"I really am having fun with this app, but, ads...and once, the app said that i've found a rare character, the app gave me 2 options, first, see a video, and second, buy premium. So this means i must pay just to see the guess is right or not? Because, i'm telling you, paying just to see an app guessing your character does not worth at all.",Yes,Humor
"Way too many ads, literally milking you for money. Find a rare character and it tells you to watch an ad. After watching the ad it doesn't give you the character. Way too many bugs. Sad how this game used to be good and now the devs just want money from the ads.",No,None
Just play it on a computer instead of downloading this ad spam. It glitchy with the scores and acts like I didn't get a black dimond and with the gold while I play. Also I really dont like having to download a game where it spams you witb ads almost if not every time you guess when you can play online with as much pestering ads. Iget that they need to make money but seriously it gets old.,No,None
"This app is super cool. It has guessed characters I didn't even know somebody would even really care about. Ads aren't such a big problem with Akinator, either. I would 100% recommend using this app if you have nothing to do and want to do something that you do not need Wifi for. It is definitely worth a five-star rating. ðð»â¤",No,None
"So I'm always pleasantly surprised by this app! First time I played, I thought this game was BS, it nailed me. I keep trying to stump this dang ð§ââï¸ but it's very difficult. Unless you deliberately give false answers, make your own character, or find some generic/obscure person even a hardcore dedicated gamer wouldn't know.... This can nail you down virtually every time. Im amazed how well it keeps up with current/new content as well. Well worth a try and great for idle like play.",No,None
So I'm shocked by this app. I honestly don't know how they have programed it to be so damn good at guessing and guessing correctly. My first character I picked katara from avatar and it didn't get it on the first try but the second and was still surprised even though it needed two guesses. My second was prince Naveen and they got it right. So I thought of a really hard one that not many people will remember these days which was princess Diana who died years ago and it got it right the first try!,No,None

"The best mind reader but, i wasn't able to guess me.ð",No,None
The ads are kinda unexpected.,No,None
it is a really fun game to play and it guesses most of them correctly but I'm giving it 4 stars because it sometimes repeats the same questions and what I don't really understand is why if akinator doesn't guess it correct we get no coins if it's not our fault we should get coins either way or whatever.ð¤ð¤ð¤ðð,Yes,Humor
"Apparently, despite already buying this app, there are still ""VIP characters"" that I must watch an ad to see, or pay again. The app's cool and all, but I don't really think I should have to watch an ad or pay more money to see the AI give me a wrong answer.",No,None
This is a great guessing game i love it,No,None
"Amazing game!! The genie will guess right every time! There are some ads, but they are not very intrusive. Making him guess memey characters is sure to get some laughs!! 5/5, would definitely reccommend. A classic boredom curer ððð",Yes,Flattery
"The sorcery that is this app is quite entertaining, and I just recently found out there's settings for more than just characters, so there's quite a lot to throw at this.....Genie? There's some things he can't guess, but I hope they learn from your answers like advertised. That's all I got, cheers!",No,None
"It's fun to see if the app can guess, though you could fix the way it asks questions, where it will repeat questions multiple times or ask questions and give awnsers that are contradictory to previously confirmed questions. for example asking if a character has ""X"" color hair when I already awnsered yes to brown 3 questions prior, or asking if they are from Anime then jumping back to cartoons despite confirming they are in fact from anime, or guessing ""Asta"" after saying ""No"" to being Orphaned.",Yes,Humor
"This game Is pretty good. While the ads can be long at times, That doesn't take away from the experience. Trying to figure out what characters would be rare is very fun!",Yes,Humor
"This is terrible. I used to play this a few yeas ago and had so much fun with it, so I downloaded it again. Now, when I enter the app, it sits on a loading screen FOREVER (literally, I found that out the hard way). It was fun while it lasted I guessð",Yes,Irony
Ads are annoying,No,None
"This game is good, but HOW COME WHENEVER I TRY TO WATCH A VIDEO IT DOESN'T WORK? I mean, it worked at first when I was trying to find out a VIP character but when I tried to watch another ad, it won't open, and it keeps doing this! (Actually it only works once if you open the game)",No,None
"I saw this app from a Youtuber, so I thought I'd download it. I was just thinking of the person in my head and he kept getting it wrong. After the 3rd time refreshing the questions, I decided to say their name outloud.""It's ___"" As soon as I did that, he asked 1 question and immediately got it right. Not sure if that's a coincidence, but I deleted it right after.",No,None
I love the app it's fun to kill time and everything. I just don't like how you can't get awards and coins from fooling the genie. Isn't that the point? To come up with a thought that stumps it? It'd be cool if you can earn points and everything by fooling him more than who played that thought last. Because if nobody had that thought then it should be a major award.,Yes,Humor
"okay this game is amazing, I just love to challenge akinator and I always play with my younger cousins. the only reason I won't give five stars Is because of the VIP characters, I don't mind watching an add to unlock them, but I can only watch a few adds and then It won't work anymore so it kills all the fun.",Yes,Humor
Very good there are ads but it comes after the guy guess the character animals or whatever i haven't play the game more that's why 4,No,None
"I remember when this first came out, it was good then and still is but when I get a specific character it says it's a ""VIP"" character? what's the deal with that, I gotta pay to submit an uncommon answer? I've redone the character many times and the ad never works...",No,None
Amazing ! I will rate 5 it can also know encanto movie! I will keep it the game is so fun! Hes sooo knowing at other!,Yes,Humor
"It's pretty decent, Akinator successfully guesses my characters often although I've lately been trying to think of slightly obscure characters in order to get high rankings. After successfully guessing my character after numerous tries, the Akinator called me out for cheating, and took 300-ish points off of my ranking. I'm not sure why it called me out for cheating and so far this is the only complaint I've had as i was on the top 100 for the last 24 hours before this happened and this feature really isn't needed.",No,None
This was fun but its now filled with ads and the akinator doesnt atcually know much. The belt system is a bit rubbish as if he looses you loose and its not like you get a ranking in the community for getting top belt. It asks me if its a male or female i asnwer then later in the same one it asks me again. Not the akinator i use to know and like. Too easy to make him 'fall'. Im disapointed.,Yes,Humor
"Can't really guess anything super rare, and the adds are bugged so I can't even see if it got my guess right or not half the tine",No,None
"This is so awesome, lol. Great game to play",Yes,Humor
Constantly asks conflicting questions. I'll tell it my character is real and it will proceed to ask me if it's from a specific video game or comic. Happens every time. This version is horrible.,No,None
"Good game in all. Only problems are ads. It gives them to you a lot, and I don't like that. Also, it can't guess everyone, only famous people, fictional or real. It won't guess a family member or something like that. I think it gets its info on internet, so while it asks questions, it is probably actually looking it up on internet. It is an alright game.",No,None
I used to really like this app before but now it gives so many ads. And every time I try to guess a character it tells me that it is a very rare character and I have to go through an ad to just find it out. Utterly disappointed.,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"They'll make you pay in order to have it guess certain characters. And it's probably wrong anyway. So if you think of one that's free, and it thinks you're going for one that's not, it forcibly ends the session. So I can't even confirm if it was right. But based on the few I did before hitting this wall, it was likely way off.",No,None
"Fun game, ads are not too intrusive.",Yes,Humor

Was really enjoying it until every character I picked was a rare character. I tried the last five presidents and three of them came up as rare characters making the rare character thing seem random and pointless. Will change my review if this is balanced out a little.

Cool game it can guess whatever i thought of Akinator is big braind!,No,None
This app is very cool.It always guesses what I think.,No,None
this app is good in all but it's kinda of not at the same time. When he guesses a character it's all of a sudden a V.I.P Character. And You Have To PAY for it to tell you the answer i think it's pretty stupid. also when you try to watch an ad for it to tell you the character it's just doesn't work. P.S Fix It And I Will Rate 5 stars edit: you fixed it,No,None
"Really fun but really glitchy, had to press the first answer about 20 times for the next question. Sometimes in the middle of the game it suddenly puts me back to the main menu. 3 stars for glitches",Yes,Humor

"This game can really read my mind, but there one problem that is there are a lot of ads",No,None
"Cool app at first. Once you have made some points for rankings though, every character seems to be VIP and you need to pay or watch ads, but the ads are broken, so there's no way to earn more points without paying",No,None
"It's a cool app, but a only if you're a VIP. The free version is frustrating because so much requires money. It's good for playing with friends and having a fun time, but I haven't used it apart from that.",Yes,Humor
"its unbelievable, few times it seemed like it actually read my mind. once i didn't know much about the character i chose and pressed ""dont know"" at almost every question, all of a sudden he asked if my character was involved in gun fights, it shocked me. one of the most intelligent app ever",Yes,Passive-Aggression
I liked the website and the app was good too... just one thing that the website couldn't guess was the Storm King from My Little Pony The Movie. I guess I will have to try to see if he can guess it in the app... This app is fun when you have time to use it... It also is worth the free download...,Yes,Humor
We have to pay money for a rare character and I won't even get ads to watch for seeing the rare character,No,None
"The only thing keeping me from rating this 1 star is my nostalgia for this game. There are so many ads and you can potentially see HUNDREDS within an hour depending on how good you are at finding rare characters. If you've got four bucks to spend on the premium I'd recommend buying the game, but otherwise? Look somewhere else if you don't want to see more ads than gameplay",No,None
"it's really bad... l mean ,l choose a character from the detective conan anime, and he said get a( VIP ) to unlock more characters!! ..but OK the ( VIP ) with money... and then say that it is a free game !!!!so bad and this game makes me feel angry I hate it ..... plz fix this game...

"Glitchy hunk of junk. The UI often breaks and freezes, or doesn't receive touch input, or sometimes the buttons animate the click, but don't do anything.",No,None
"Free for the first day (with ads), after that you can still play, but you have to spend $3.99 to see the results. Rip off. Still... Two stars, simply because I've been a fan of Akinator since it was just a little flash game.",No,None
Loooove it. Pretty sure it's spying on you though lol,No,None
"Every time I get a VIP character I have to waych an ad, which doesnt work and always freezes my game. Most of the time its probably not my character and I can't keep going, forcing me yo restart.",No,None
I give it a 3 star because it can't guess everything I'm thinking like I tried Alice Angle but it gave me the evil one so it was mostly right but not completely right.,No,None
"I accidentally purchased the VIP Potion, and I want a refund but am unsure how to. But over all good game.",Yes,Humor
"Unfair Ranking, think you can get the top? Good luck, you'll probably end up being penalized and getting booted down to the bottom.",No,None
This app has red because tells me what I'm thinking and I get coins and I could customize a genie so I put like four star rating,No,None
"I like the game, but after my first round, when I press let's go to play again, it doesn't work",No,None
Amazing app everything I think of something it gets it correctly I have never won and I think it deserves a 10/10,Yes,Flattery

Really fun. I am VERY impressed never got anything wrong ever when I thought it would!,Yes,Humor
I like the app but the cloths should be free for new player just custom ones not the one you have to buy,No,None
"The game is great but sometimes when I play the game it glitches and sometime makes me leave the game,but get game I love it",No,None
i am giving this a 3 star becues i love it but it pops on the music randomly and has some ads not the best but ok,No,None
It's good but there's a glich when I watch an ad it doesn't give the aki award,No,None
"I think the app's ok, but the ads are annoying :/",No,None
I love its very cool any thing i think about he says even cartoon charectars it is the best game i played thank you for making this gameðð¯ðð,No,None
Too many adds. And the app doesn't load fast at the start,No,None

This is so crazy fun I've been playing for hours nonstop it's so much fun,Yes,Humor
I recommended this app when you're bored! Its really fun to play! I rate it 5 STARS!,Yes,Humor
I'mma just have to write a review so it won't pop up all the time. It's a good app.,No,None
it's kinda creepy because I didn't say it but I was thinking of it in my head but he knewðso it's a good app would recommend!,No,None
"Fun until one of the guesses is held ransom as a ""VIP Character"" for you to either pay $4 or watch a broken advertisement that won't let you exit back to the game. Akinator didn't used to be like this. I remember the old days where you could play for free to your hearts content without it asking for money or showing you a grotesque amount of advertisements.",Yes,Humor
doesn't give me the platinum or black answers on my rank score even when I get them. Happened a few times. sometimes I play through the same questions to try and get the answer again and it still doesnt add it even though it comes up with platinum or gold again. so silly. if it cant update my score properly I am going to delete the app sorry.,No,None
"Great fun! I, personally, loved it.",Yes,Humor
I wouldn't give a star .. after the latest update. I have been trying to get a character . They have given both the time rejection .. saying they will lower the rank next time .. what kind of game and attitude is that in a game for both kids and adults . Either they will fix that soon or it might piss people off .. if u can't get guess a character doesn't necessarily mean I am pressing randomly.,No,None
"This app is soo cool its the way it just knows what your thinking about I swear it's not black magic it's just an app that you can play with your friends and family thanks to the kids safe mode and also if you can't think of a character then you can think of an animal, TV or movie show and even objects",No,None
Great app! Just please fix the essue that when you want to see if he got your character right or object he just says its a object. I dont like this and I'd like to be able to play the game more and have it funner and please make this app have less adds. Thank you! Other than that great game.ð,Yes,Humor
Personally I have always loved this app and it's still no less great! People here seem to have really mixed opinions but I really am enjoying it so far as I always have since quite a while back. Absolutely amazing app helping me through quarantine too.,Yes,Flattery
"Generally I love the app and I like challenging it, but it doesn't know all the characters and it keeps repeating the questions when I choose a hard one.",No,None
"This has been free on web broswers for years. I don't even understand how the people behind Akinator could even think to try and get us to pay for anything in this app. The minute I played and got a vip character which basically wants you to shell out money to see. My respect for Akinator has flown out the window. I remember them trying to charge just to download the app a while back. I loved this game for years and now their greed ruined it. Never again am I playing this, even on a browser.",No,None
"I've had the app for months if not years, but I went to play today and it made me create an account. Lo and behold, when I created the account and logged in all of my characters disappeared. I will be deleting my account and uninstalling immediately.",No,None
i shouldnt have to buy this app. after a few rounds this app will claim that every character is a special character to be unlocked either by paying a one time fee or by watching a 30 second advert.,No,None
"Fun, I thought of the most random character and it lead me there.",Yes,Humor
"literally to many ads, every time after i play a round an ad pops up. i understand that you guys need money but it ruins the fun of the game. im pretty sure its seriously annoying to anyone that plays ð",Yes,Humor
"It has a lot of ads, which is fine. But then on top of that, it has VIP characters which means you have to have a VIP account to get the full effect of this game since the point of it is to try to challenge it. So the game is not actually free, and it's a bit of a swindle.",No,None
"guesses a lot of very famous people but as soon as you make it harder he hasnt got a clue. seems a bit silly you dont get ""rewards"" if he fails to guess first time, i cant help the app isnt as smart as it thinks. if it doesnt know the answer it asks you to give them it again with no reward. backwards if you ask me",No,None
"Whenever I discover a rare character, when I play the video or take a survey, it doesn't work. So the game isn't fun anymore. I discovered 3 rare characters before quitting cause I can't see them anyways.",Yes,Humor
"Don't download this game! When I played this game a year ago, my phone started to lag and then I tried getting in my phone and it didn't work. Even my friends tried fixing my phone but it was no use. I know my phone was really bad, but still, this game might have a virus, don't download it! I have this game on my new phone and nothing has happened yet, or maybe it's destroying my phone really slowly. One of my reviews was deleted before so I'm writing this. Don't play Akinator!",No,None
"Weird, fun ""game"" - not something I can play all the time, but addicting and mildly creepy. I can't believe some of the crazy stuff Akinator has been able to guess in less than 5 turns. Really fun at parties lol",Yes,Irony
Advertisements are required for certain results but some of them cannot be closed after the ad has run its course forcing you to restart the game causing you to lose your progress.,No,None
Great game!! He seems to guess everything right,No,None
Very good game like free fire and pugb,No,None
Whenever I try to guess something and it gets it right it removes my points and says I didn't guess it terrible feature,Yes,Irony
Idk how the devs made the coding for this app... This is so great that it almost guesses all the things correctly. Great app !!!!,No,None
I give akinator a five star rating because he guesses my characters every time and I bet the people that made akinator put a lot of effort into him.,No,None
"It was fun for the first 5-10 minutes, but then the vip character thing came up. It's a complete joke. I can tell that the character was not actually a vip character and that it's just a stupid pop-up. i played the character two times before and both times he wasn't a vip. i am not going to pay money just to see a name and picture that may not even be the correct one.",Yes,Humor
"Idk why, but once I install it I can play it. But then after I close it ince, it doesn't reipen and I'm stuck on the first screen fix this bug please. Otherwise the game is good.",No,None
It guessed ALL of my charaters! This app is super fun and I LOVE it. I definitly suggest this app!,Yes,Humor
"yeah obviously the ads make the game unfun to play but my biggest issue is the fact that it awards you for letting akinator guess it right. like it will not give you the full reward if it doesnt get it right the first time which is ABSOLUTELY retarded because AKINATOR got it wrong, not me. why am i the one getting punished. otherwise, this game is an obvious scheme for your money, dont give in",Yes,Humor
This is not called guess. When I thought of the Avatar character after few questions it asks if it belongs to Avatar series. Its like asking your favourate colour(yoi say red) and saying that your favourate color is red. Same happened to the flash. It just aske if it is from the flash series. One thing I like is that there are so many questions which may not be made by human.,No,None
"Went to guess a ""rare character"", and had to watch 5 minutes worth of ads, all for it just to be a bronze. Nice.",No,None
The reason I gave it 3 stars because 1st time I downloaded so it was working very good but second time I downloaded it so some problem was coming good app but some problem are in it by the way this app is really magical it can really read your mind and I have gave it 5 stars for the first time but when problem occurs I edited my review. I think it is a good app.,No,None
"Makes you watch the ad but doesn't open the character. Also, if it doesn't guess your character it penalizes you by not giving you the special awards.",No,None
"Has innapropriate content..... Please remove this. I clicked random yes and no's and this thing comes up? I didn't ask for this, I didn't know about it. The worst part is, you had a picture!!! Why?! This is a terrible thing! Please take this off, it's not cool! And if people want to guess that, please, before they start the game, warn them about your restrictions on bad content! Please, lots of children use this. They don't need to be exposed like that.",Yes,Irony
"This app is amazing! It has no lag. And the amazing thing is that it has guessed every single character i have thought of! I did some of the characters from how to train your dragon. (Im a big fan ;>) i did astird, hiccup, toothless, and tuffnut. Amazing! I recommend you download this!",Yes,Flattery
"I enjoy this app, however, when you guess special VIP characters you either have to pay to see or watch an ad, the ad runs fine until the end where it's impossible to get out of the Honda ad that ended because it wouldn't let me leave for some reason. Please fix this.",No,None
"What is the point of the ""rare characters"" if the only option you can choose is No Thanks? I've had these ""rare characters"" multiple times and the only thing I can choose is the No Thanks option other than See Video.",No,None
Alot of options. The app runs a little slow. The game is fun to play with the family. It gets old really fast. But over all the game is pretty amusing and will take up time. A fast cure when you get bored. Just don't expect 24 hours of super fun times.,Yes,Humor
"Um scary. Possible microphone, but even without that it still guesses. The one thing I dont like about it is that the minute you think you stump it... it goes premium. But either way, it really is insanely accurate",Yes,Passive-Aggression
"It started saying every character I picked was ""rare"" (so I'd have to watch an ad) even when I come up with the most common mainstream characters I could think of like Mickey Mouse--it said Mickey Mouse was rare. What a joke. At least be honest and just say you want me to watch an ad for every character I pick. I remember when Akinator wasn't a giant cash grab.",No,None
Love it and don't like adds,No,None
This is so amazing so far all right!!,Yes,Flattery
"To win the rare awards now he HAS to guess on the first try. The purpose of these games is to stump the guesser. Edit : Actually you can't get the rare awards at all. The option to watch a video or buy the ""premium potion"" isn't selectable. Never had a workable version of this game after all these years of trying to see if it got better.",No,None
"So cool :0 I can't believe how precise it is! Once I randomly selected Jaiden Animations, and BLAM, Akinator guessed her! The app's very good, and it doesn't have a lot of ads! Only after ending a game, I think. Install this thingy and you'll have so much fun :)",Yes,Irony
Nice but it lack sometimes,No,None
"Used to be good, now it sells your data and attacks you with adverts. It randomly hangs at points which it didnt used to do, I can only assume it's because its connecting to the web to either stick another advert in my face or to analyse my fingerprints and blood type.",No,None
"Won't load and it makes me sad bc I used to LOVE to guess Creepypasta characters, Sonic Characters, YouTubers, and eventually myself (never worked). I really wanted to play this again, but it won't load. If you guys could fix this pls, I'll consider downloading it back on to my phone. :) Thanksâ¨",No,None
"On my third game I found an ""exclusive character"" that I needed to pay to see if the game had got it right. When I hit no thanks the game had restarted, don't know why you wouldn't just play the browser version",No,None
"I love this game, and I would give 5 stars but there's one feature missing which I eish you would add. That being the ability to see your character history. Something similar to what there already is for gold, platinum and black awards, but fkr all of the Aki Awards. Add this in and I will change to 5 stars.",No,None
"every guess i made was rare, way too much adds.",No,None
"This app has a good thing going. People submit questions about characters, and then people guess the character associated with the questions. My only problem is that the game is a bit annoying to find obscure enough characters to get good scores.",No,None
"I hate this game! Every time I play it it sets traps for no reason, and sometimes if you don't have enough info about a specific thing it still thinks that you're cheating. One day it set three traps in a row for no reason. I lost two black awards because of this!!",No,None
I love it it is it good for me yeah yeah yeah is my gift give it up give it up give it up I don't know how I got this gift but I know it is awesome,Yes,Humor
"Pretty cool ,but hate it when I give a VIP answer and I can't see the results. I have to pay or watch an ad,but there is no ad to watch just disappointing. No point in playing for free and having to pay to see how rare or if it is even right.",No,None
"I can't get onto it as it continuously crashes. It seems fun, but this is just a really big issue for me and I can't really rate it if there is some sort of bug that prevents me from getting into the game. One star.",Yes,Humor
Kinda slow when I got a rare guess I clicked ad and I watched it but it didnt even give me what I got a badge. I think I give up Im never playing again :(,No,None
"Please, how cool. I thought it wouldn't know much",No,None
"This app is so cool but if the creator is here can he/she remove the add. Its know that I was thinking of the doll form squid game , huggy wuggy , THICC SHARK AND Mario to I like this app",No,None
I just downloaded it and wont let me in it kicks me out and I can't even play the game . My brother has the same problem so please fix this and it is a big problem for some people. Can you please make it offline game so families that dont have service or wifi can atleast play it. My freind says it's a good game once you have service and or wifi. She says there are ads just to see the person akinator guessed. On my tablet it says I need an account to play even tho I have an account. Thx for read.,No,None
Ads after every single guess and an ad if he makes a rare guess. Annoying and boring. I bought this app years ago for Â£1.50 and now it's Â£4. Will probably stop playing because of all the ads,No,None

How does he know everything I mean he guessed all of my things even Boris The Wolf and bendy and the ink machine and five nights at Freddy's but I will crash this game no I won't but I will find a way how to confuse him!,No,None
"This app has become worse after all these years... With the ad flooding and the ""watch a video or unlock premium to see the character"" just makes this app generally annoying to use. I understand that you need money and whatnot, but seriously? ""Buy premium to see the character? That's ridiculous!",No,None
He is sooo cool he even got my daughters favorite YouTuber .ð,No,None
"Every person told about his/her character, objects and tv shows and movies. This app just search the information which you put and give you answer.... This is a amazing app for those who don't know which is running behind the scenes ð¤£.I understand all the strategy all the methods behinds this app . But such a amazing work on this app,work on this app make it amazing and outstanding.....",Yes,Flattery
"Repetitive questions. If you think of a that isn't very mainstream or is a side character, such as Lee from East of Eden, and Bakuryu the Mole from bloody roar, along with Lennart Green the real life card magician, it will not be able to guess it. That would be fine, but it has a ranking system for points, and if the app with its very repetitive questions (it asked me if lee was human 7 times out of 78 questions) does not guess your character on its first try, you cannot properly participate in its ranking system.",No,None
"won't let me pay from an alternate account, can only pay from the first account i downloaded it under. even after i uninstalled, and reinstalled from the account that can pay, it can only see the first account. bad coding means you don't get the money i was willing to give you.",No,None
It's a nice game but when I bought the primuim adds and again adds and I removed it and it's still with me I can't uninstall this app for ever and when I went to read the opened then I tryed to remove it but it's still not removed what is this then I closed my tab then removed it but it's still not working and now I tryed to remove but it didn't work I bought the primuim potion but there's still adds what's up in this game I will report this problem,No,None

This game is okay. Not too bad but not too great also. Most of the time it gets my character correct but there are times when it is not able to guess my character accurately. It is addictive at first but not so much after 3 to 4 days. It gets old eventually and is not so fun after some time...,Yes,Humor
"Very nice game ð akinator always guesses my toughts amazing work , but there's one problem that I installed this at the morning and now in the evening, every time I try to play , only half of the game was completed and there is always written - a technical problem has occurred so pls fix this bug , other than that , everything is awesome ð I recommend everyone to download it right now âºï¸âºï¸âºï¸âºï¸âºï¸âºï¸âºï¸",Yes,Humor
I love the game but ads come in and ruin it,No,None
"a fun time killer, but has some real scummy cash-grabs; namely, if your character happens to be a ""VIP character"" (whatever that's supposed to mean), then you must either watch a video (P.S. the video function ""accidentally"" doesn't work, so you can only do this next option: ) or pay $2 to remove ads and see the guessed character.",Yes,Humor
"It doesn't let me play at all whenever I press ""Let's go"" it just loads for 15 mins and then returns to the title screen and says ""There's a technical problem"" or something similar.",No,None

It's a good game for timepass,No,None
"It's not starting. Only that elokence screen with music is opened from last 1.5 hour. Even internet connection is decent(1-5mbps). And, hence, proved this the worst application. Try fixing that.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"This app is so cool and amazing! It is really fun to play, you think of a character and akinator tries to guess it, it is so fun. The only thing is that it doesn't save the points you can get and it is a bit of a waste of time if you are doing it for points and not entertainment, so that is why I gave this app 4 stars.",Yes,Humor
This app is so amazing and mind reading app thats great ðððâ¤â¤ð¤ð¤,Yes,Flattery
I think that this is a very cool game and it has read my mind several times which I find quite cool. But the downside to this game in my opinion is that if you do the objects theme usually the first question Akinator asks you is whether or not you object has to do with sex. It kind of bothers me because it's the first question that comes up every time. Apart from that I think it's a cool game!,No,None
"Very good game. Occasionally cuts off all sounds and doesn't allow me to watch advertisements when I have found a VIP character, but overall, this game is excellent!",Yes,Flattery
"He was finally unable to guess my character! I was thinking of David from the Book of Lost Things, but instead he came up with some random anime boy. Plus, when I was searching for the probable characters that he came up with, David wasn't there. Let's go! I beat him!",No,None
too many adds almost every character is a rare character and i have to watch an add every time he guesses the right character and i have to watch an add everytime theres a rare character and half the time he guesses wrong please make it no adds this would make my reveiw a 5 star and that woul make everyone a lot happier and i know developer your not gonna see this but if you do please just get rid of the adds because you can make another add simulator so please just remove the adds on this,No,None
"Would rate higher if the ""validity checker"" feature actually worked correctly and didn't punish me for saying Akinator actually picked the character I was thinking of. There's gotta a better system behind it to prevent mistakes so I don't lose the stuff I earned for no reason other than buggy AI.",No,None
Akinator is a good game to play. The only thing I don't like is it glitches sometimes. And it will exit out of the game. Other than that it's a good game. It's fun to play if you are on a car ride or just stuck doing nothing it's kind of funny when it guess the wrong person.ððð,Yes,Humor
"I spent 30 mins of him just guessing wrong over and over for a relatively simple one, a princess fo japan and it only gave me a standard even though he couldn't even guess it, I could never imagine how you'd get a platinum...

I opened the app after the update and it didn't even work. It just displayed the loading sign for hours at 0%. Even after I deleted and reinstalled the app.,No,None
Great app just to many adds. Then pay to.get results....uninstalled,No,None
"When I think of rare/specific characters, it never guesses them! Probably on purpose so I can't get the rare points. It either won't ask specific enough questions and make a wrong guess too early or go down a specific line of questioning that's wrong and won't leave it and guesses a character that it can't be based on my answers (ex: is your character german? No. Is your character from germany? No. Is your character related to germany? No. *Guesses german character* ð",No,None

"I love how this game can be put on children mode, but I think that there should also be a place catagorie and maybe a song catagorie? And it is so easy to play. Really all you have to do is answer questions, and he reads your mind! Its is an awesome game, download it RIGHT NOW!",Yes,Humor

"It is pretty good at guessing, really. Of course it learns from its users so not -suuper impressive. But it is a fun app. It works well and has some interesting tools to play with. I haven't made my account yet but it does seem like that works and probably isn't overbearing. Pretty good app, imo.",Yes,Humor
This app makes me so interesting and intense,No,None
"This game used to function perfectly fine on a web browser, but now it forces you to download the app if you want to play more than once. Entirely unnecessary. That alone is worth a zero-star rating, but now, I downloaded the app anyway, and I couldn't even play once without it telling me I HAVE to pay $4 for the full game. Not one guess! And I knew its guess was going to be wrong anyway from how the prompt was phrased. There's absolutely no point to this app, it doesn't do anything.",Yes,Humor
Inaccurate and only allows you 10 free rounds after which it tries to force you into a subscription service. And they got the nerve to ask you to improve their apps accuracy.,No,None
THIS IS A VERY GOOD GAME THATS WHY I GIVE IT 5 STARS,No,None
"I dont understand this app anymore, why is every person ""rare"" even the most famous people are rare and I have to watch an ad because it's rare? Also when I beat him like 3 times it said I couldn't have the reward, so basically I sat through a bunch of ads for nothing? This app was good 4 years ago I don't know what happened.",No,None
"The questions asked are so contradictory. They will ask about the gender multiple times if i choose to continue, etc. I have also been denied golds and platinums countless times because the genie is unable to guess my character, which is really stupid as that just means that the genie wasn't smart enough to figure it out. Asking if the character has a foreign sounding name is dumb. Foreign sounding to whom? Me? If I say a Japanese name to an Indian, it would obviously sound foreign.",No,None
"Can't guess anything half of the time, the reward system doesn't make sense, and the ads after a ""failed attempt at guessing"" are frustrating. My gratitude to whomever ruined the app.",No,None
Really really good it actually read my mind,No,None
I love this game it thinks of almost anything your thinking about!! But the reason. Why I gave it four stare is that it asked my location!!?? I was very surprised by that besides that everything is perfect no glitching !! ( Also I'd love if you could update it ð¤),No,None
No adds very fun actually works and is super easy to play. I love this game because there are multiple sections to choose from and it always guesses what I am thinking,Yes,Humor

I like this app in my first try it already got it! So amazing,Yes,Flattery
It's an ok game but it is ridiculus that i get punished with no reward because the game is bad at guessing what i'm thinking of. The system for level is confusing as well. What makes something standard vs. gold?,No,None
"This app don't know many famous singer or legends of India. It repeat same question many times. It only know youtubers. Its for people who's life starts from youtube and ends at youtube.

He didn't findy chanal so is not that cool so I will rate 2 star only,No,None
I hate this game. They can't really read our minds. For guessing animals I did think of the bullet ant and it guessed right but when I pressed yes it said I cheated and validated my points. Freakin annoying and full of bshits of course. Don't create a mind reading game if you can't really make simple guesses right!!!,No,None

This game is so good because he can rrad my mind..,No,None

"THIS APP IS VERY VERY VERY COOLSOME! It guesses your charecter that you this is and click and awnser of what he asks you when he trying to geuss! 5 STARS!

But, thank you for making this app",No,None

"Akinator is pretty cool! The guesser of things since I was back in 5th grade, it's been over 5 years and still gets up to date but sometimes there's many ads more than the usual but that's understandable. Cool thing is that I think of really hard characters and he never guesses them so think clever guys!",No,None
Akinator is soo good... I mean How can some app be soo perfect... The only problem is that I wish it could recognize some infamous channels also. Rest I am happy...good job,No,None

At first i thought how can it tell everything. But when i played it just blew my mind in first 2 plays only. It told the correct imagination of my mind without even asking questions which were sufficient to tell. The game isnjust wow!! Huge respect to the developer/developer team.,No,None

This app is very wonderful I never gives reviews to any game but I'm giving to it because it's wonderful,No,None
"It is an amazing app, the ability to predict who I was thinking was exceptional however the past 5 goes I've had it says it's been ""checking the validity"" and accused me of trying to claim the coins. The last person I tried to go for was James Potter from Harry potter. It guessed correctly and asked if it was my character. I said yes, but then it said that i was trying to claim the coins again and deducted me on the leaderboard. Please fix this!!",Yes,Flattery
It's awesome but I hate the ads,Yes,Humor

"The developer has turned a fun little game to play with your friends on the internet in to a cheap marketed game which needs you to buy access or view an ad to see half the characters Akinator guessed. Would rather play the browser version: 100% free, and no ads or 'Buy VIP to view this character'.",Yes,Humor
"Cant use without internet, after watching ad video for answer you dont get answer",No,None
Makes me watch an advert to reveal the character on almost every run. Also now attempts to set traps and will deduct points from you. This game used to be fun but it kinda sucks now.,Yes,Humor
"I'm not gonna lie when I say this is very impressive. It really can guess whatever you are thinking of, from your favorite tv show character even to your household pet. Excellent work on this app don't change a thing it is already perfect. ð",Yes,Flattery
I really enjoy this app tbh however its kind of lame that there is a limit to the amount of ads you can watch to reveal rare characters. Other than that it's a great app.,No,None
"It keeps rejecting my attempts and penalizing me for no reason, im just trying to play the game, and it sometimes doesn't let me watch a video for the rare answer, so much potential, not well done",No,None
amazing app enjoyed the game and its pourpase. they game had a wide spread variety of awesomeness to guess from. the thing that keeps it from getting a 5 star is just some lag issues and i am not the only one experiencing them. however a great game,Yes,Humor
"The game overall is okay but there isn't really much to do, as it's just press some buttons and boom genie guesses the character that you're thinking of. It'd be nice if there was more to the game because to me it's just not as entertaining as it should be. I used to play Akinator when I was a kid because I found it shocking that it could guess what I was thinking of, now it's just not as special as back then..",No,None
"I downloaded this game a couple years ago and loved it but after a while it became boring to me. I recently downloaded it again and I'm still enjoying it. I also love how there are no adds, some games have a ton of adds and that's one of the few reasons why people don't like them.",No,None
This game just turned into a money hungry game. i love this game but there is so much adds and mostly you do not even get your prizes or for me it just glitches me out of the game and it takes forever to get back in the game.please FIX THIS APP!,No,None
"This game how's gone down hill a good bit you have to pay for premium which essentially means paying to possibly get the character you wanted, also they have installed an anti cheat which in my opinion ruins a part of the game but that's just me, I do understand why they did it and I'm not mad about it. I'm mostly mad about the paying part. Question for the devs: can I get taken off the leaderboard so I can screw around alone without the anti cheat yelling at me? part of my fun is discovering.",Yes,Humor
Amazing I was think of YipYap The Destroyer but it got ungoy/grunt from Halowhich I guess counts but amazing game,Yes,Flattery
"I thought the point was to try to ""out wit"" the Akinator... But when you do now it's a ""Rare guess"" or whatever and you have to watch an ad or pay $4 to see if he got it right? That's makes zero sense. I used to love this app :(",No,None
I enjoyed it up until the ads bugged it out. There are SO MANY ads! I watched one to view my answer and it crashed.,No,None
It was fun until you wanted to see a rare charecter. It makes you watch a video or buy something. It is money hungry. And when i tried watching the video it didnt let me watch it and im mad,Yes,Humor

"I liked it but all the time on my computer it wont let me pick another one after I already did one. When this happends I have to close out then have to get back in so I gave this a 3star,if they fix this I will give a 5stars.",No,None
"The questions repeat them selves and also contradicts there previous question. Eg. Is your character male . Yes. Is your character female. I already said it was male. And the object theme asks the question ""Is it an object."" I wouldn't be on the object theme if it wasn't an object.",No,None
I have one problem. It's that when you make an account after Akinator guesses more stuff it told me to an account and I was very confused because I already made one. So I made one more. After more guesses it said the same thing. Please fix this.,No,None
"The app has become so money hungry now. Every other character is a ârare"" character which includes you having to pay or watch some ridiculous ad. Not to mention he's starting to get slot of guesses wrong.",No,None
"I don't if it works on my Samsung and I don't know of it's offline or not, but I'm pretty sure it glitches and won't open, sometimes I'm stuck in a reload screen",No,None

"Its fun but the questions are repetitive. Especially on the first question, it kept asking whether a chracter is from a japanese anime. Aside from that, it was fun.",Yes,Humor
Actually this app doesn't even deserve I star cuz when I open the app it's always loading loading loading it never opens and when I go out of the app the sound is still there and my mobile keeps being vibrated even though I didn't vibrate it.

"Akinator works exactly as stated, and more! He'll guess characters as obscure as Canderous Ordo, or as well known as Peter Griffin. He'll even guess objects and concepts! The ads aren't obstructive, spammy, or even all that common. Definitely will be using him more",No,None
Nice one. It predicts correct but you need information regarding your character. Although sometimes it fails I enjoy playing it .,No,None
Its probably a good for your timepass but the thing i dont like is that when you think of rare character or anything they will give us three option watch video buy premium or leave your Aki award and they do not give us to watch video to get our Aki award and we have to think of it again and sometime it guesses wrong and the thing is they will give us ad to show but not when we have claim our Aki award you should make it free,No,None

This game sucks.",No,None
I really like this game because it's a nice time killer but one thing for parents to keep in mind when I put the child lock on it's not a lock for a 3 year old or an 8 year old because it has questions like is your character known for showing theire body or are they known for flashing Theire abs so this is basically a child lock for a bit older kids so if doing it with younger kids you can put the child lock and let your kids play with your supervision,No,None
I mean i kinda like it but it needs some fixing. once when i was about to win a game the guy just exited me out. the guy needs to execpt his a defeat. it makes me salty that i don't get an aki award even though I WIN FAIR AND SQUARE I TRIED MY HARDEST AND I DON'T EVEN GET A STANDARD BADGE!!!!!

I lts awesome but I think the game can hear through the phone cuz everytime I say the answer it's correct and if not I have to do a second try soooooo it MIGHT BE cheating.....but some times its the other way around so yeah...,Yes,Humor
"Honestly I loved this game a long time ago when I wanted to download it again cause I missed it everything has gone bad first off you have to pay money just to see characters that are ""vip"" and now you need wifi to use it, a long time ago it was so much better but just wanna say this game has gone bad and I wanna rate it 1 star",No,None
"It's really frustrating that he got my characters, especially Mikaela from Owari no seraph, I hadn't expect him to get that since it's a pretty old anime but he did! It surprised me but it's really fun to come up with the new characters and people for him to guess",Yes,Humor
Very fun game. Surprisingly full of obscure characters and people. Would've given it 4 stars but I don't like the stupid VIP thing. I only have to watch an ad though. Could be worse.,Yes,Humor
This is the m0oo0stst piecre of tracshh ever. I rather eat out of the garbage than play this game. No one should ever have to spend money on him guessing a stupid character. The company who made this piece of trash game are complete idiots. I also have to mention that they made me usey data on this game even though I bought this game on another device and they didn't make me use data or internet. This game is one of the worst games ever I definitely do not recommend this piece of garbage anyone.,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"After a few turns, the game will start giving you ""VIP characters"" where you have to pay $2 in order to see Akinator's guess. This is ridiculous for a game that can be played for free without ads in a web browser.",No,None
"Well it took about 4 sessions before it guessed ONE character correctly, but well it is accurate when you don't answer any 'I don't know'. But it really made me excited when he asked 'is your character in girl meets world' and It finally answered correctly... Sabrina Carpenter.",No,None
Bestest guesser & free i like it can guess but it was wrong sometime so you can say no and continue further to give hints and if first time akinator was wrong after continue to akinator & giving him some hint s it can guess your character and it doesn't started again it says network connection problem retry iam very angry due to this problem so you need to modify and repair akinator,No,None
I love this app! This app actually reads my mind! And its also very fun! Wouldnt say anything more because there are ni glithes! Ads dont make me annoyed really much because there arent that many ads! Love the game,Yes,Humor
"This app used to be very good until you had to pay to have him guess certain characters this wouldn't be so bad if they didn't do the same to the PC version until they change this, stay away from this app it's a waste of space and money",No,None
"I liked it, it made no trouble at all to play but if the ads could be stopped and the graphics could be improved. I bet more people will play",No,None
Wow great app. Shame that all obscure characters are behind a paywall. The point of the apl is to try and beat it. You'd think an app which relied on user inout to function for years if it didnt have it in the database would be more charitbale to the userbase. Stopped being fun the fifth time it was behind the paywall,Yes,Humor
"Even though I watch the ads to get a rare character, it won't let me see it. I'm not wasting money on a potion or anything, so I'm getting robbed out of some fair Aki Awards. I even downloaded the game and it didn't work. If this is not fixed, I will uninstall.",No,None
"Fantastic app,but on my tablet (Lenovo Tab 2) after 6 or 7 questions app just freeze and restart,and then i need to start again fresh start.Please fix that stability issue.Otherwise,everything about this app is just FANTASTIC.Greetings from Serbia",No,None
"This game is fun but I have to watch an ad, and at the end akinator ends up up saying ""I don't know what that is"" So its a ad for nothing it is frustrating. But its fun but I'd like more questions",Yes,Humor
"I've used it before and it's cool, but this app after I install it, WONT LOAD. I can't even use the website because it has limits. My only issue is that it won't load and I haven't found other issues but maybe that's because I can't see them.",No,None
"This app doesn't make any sense. So at the first round he guessed what I was thinking correctly and when I tried to make him guess the same character he guessed the first round he couldnt figure out who I was thinking about and just said ""your character is not one of the most popular characters"" WHEN HE HAD GUESSED IT BEFORE!!! Not recommended.",No,None
"Good game,it's just that when he guesses he's not that specific on names so if he was,that would be much appreciated. :D The fact that I put in answers about myself and he just says ""you"" (unless I'm a famous person) is kinda annoying and would be a better game if they specify the names like they would do for a famous person maybe it's just me but, saying ""you"" isn't very specific.",No,None
I LOVE THIS APPPPPPPP just one thing could you add the option to add ships like tododeku while using character theme could you also make it guess something plural if you do that it would be great but it's okay anyway,No,None
"Very fun app, especially to play with my Family and friends. one thing I must add though is that it tends to trap me even if the character that it says was not the one I was thinking of, even if it was.",Yes,Humor
"THIS IS VERY CREEPY! It's like it watching you, it's so terrifying and sketchy, DO NOT INSTALL, 0 STARS And Although it does ""guess your character"" it has an add after every single one and for some it even makes you pay to tell you the character.",No,None
"So if you pick easy ones it isnt fun and you are unlikely to get awards, but the game punishes you for picking ones that are hard by not giving you awards if Aki guesses wrong. I've had him guess wrong several times and it is annoying.",Yes,Humor
It would be a 5 if not for the validity rejected award. If your gonna add a mechanic that only allows you to get an aki award if he gets it right on the first try then you can't have validity rejected. Who would say no that is taking an aki award away from them. Its not their fault you got it wrong but we can still take the award. Adding validity rejection with a mechanic like that is stupid and wrong,No,None
Love this app. However crashes a lot during questions. or when its incorrect on its guess and says can I keep guessing there is always in error instead. Please Fix..,No,None
"I like this game. Its very fun to play. But I would like 1 thing to be added, It would be great if There was a ""Game"" Theme, It would be amazing if it was added. But I have no other problem so I rate this game 5 stars. Thank you. ð",Yes,Humor

The game is fun but they are so money hungry. Tons and tons of ads that gets in the buttons way and some characters require the premium version to access,Yes,Humor
"Got a decently high score only for the game to decide I have been answering irregularly and therefore penalised me and halved my score (yes I was answering truthfully) So I gave up. As a side note the game contradicts itself, such as asking a question like ""does your character have black hair?"" My answer: ""Yes"" then it proceeds to ask me ""does your character have blonde hair?""",No,None
Useless app and totally a wastage of time. please don't install it... contain more ads than the app itself... recommended by a YouTuber but annoying... if you want to get annoyed install it.... Good luck!,No,None
This app is really good it guessed everyone i was thinking of but there is 1 problem. There is an ad everytime i finish so maybe u can decrease the ads please. If u do that ill edit and give it a 5 star review,No,None
"I love this app, have played it since it was only a website. My only complaint is that when I go off the app and come back, the music stops playing. Please fix this.",No,None
"I love this app, it's almost eerie how much it can guess. Could do with less ads, but as a free and fun app, I can't complain.",Yes,Humor
. When i was choosing a person i got the VIP tab. And they were getting really close to close to the aswer then i got the VIP tab. When I try to click the ad button IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK. Disappointed,Yes,Self-Deprecation
"its fun off course but what really made me upset is how whenever i get anything above silver rank characters, it wont register them into my badges as higher rank characters. its very annoying and makes me feel unaccomplished.",Yes,Humor
"It was cool back when you could just use it without them wanting to sell all your information in order to guess more than a few times. Shout out to the original creators, I hope they sold it and they aren't doing this hogwash themselves",No,None
"It is a good name but there is a lot of ads after every guess ,tht has become a reason why this app is just at the corner of my mobile i dont like to use it coz of all the ads I think ads must really be removed",No,None
I wish I could vote zero stars I was spending so much time to get this person and it keeps rejecting me and I used be in 15 th rank now I'm in 647 this horrible what have I done to get this and this is the first time downloading I got addicted and I hate it now . HORRIBLE BUT ADDICTIVE GAME WHICH IS BAD IM 11 YEARS OLD THEY DONT ALLOW ME TO TAKE A SIMPLE SURVEY HORRIBLE I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE ZERO STARS .,No,None
I like it its fun but there are way to many ads take out the ads and ill rate it a 5 completely plz stop the ads it not as good with the ads thats why i gave it a three im sorry but way to many ads Sadly its not a five but i still like playing to try to make him guess me plz say yes if u agree,Yes,Humor
This app is very intresting but in this we have a option to change clothes so the clothes are very expensive so if the coins can be reduced better othervise very good game,No,None
"fun, but there are some glitches. every time we win a VIP character, it says pay $5 or watch an ad, but we cannot click the watch ad button it doesn't work.",Yes,Humor
"""You found a VIP character"". It's a scam because you can see the same character twice and have it appear as a ""VIP"" (pay to see) character the first time and then have it appear normal the second time.",No,None
"I've had this app for many many years on several devices and I loved it. HOWEVER when I downloaded it to my most recent device, my VIP membership didn't transfer over. This game is now worthless to me.",No,None
It used to be good but now it's horrible. It would be fun but the fact you need to pay money to get some people the Akinator can guess is stupid. The VIP is fine but don't make it that important. May as well just make the game cost money if you're gonna do that.,Yes,Humor
I like it very much! Its always so cool how akinator guesses the person you are thinking. How on earth does he do it?!?!? ð Very great app to use if you are bored. Also great to use with friends and familyð whenever you are bored ð 100/10. ð,No,None
"It didn't open at first. I kept getting 'PROBLEM_RESEAU' when I tried opening the app several times. But it's okay now. Just fix, so it doesn't happen again",No,None
"I like the app it's great, but if I'm looking up something that I have before and get the answers the same it comes up with a different character! I would rate 5 stars if it wasn't an issue.",No,None
"Keeps encountering an error when Akinator doesn't guess correctly, and I keep getting the CHEATED screen for things that I'm actually thinking of.",No,None
"Great game and time killer and it's crazy how on point the akinator is. Only issue is the validity checks because when I was going for beatrix from ""kill bill"" it showed me the actual actress Uma and thinking nothing of it and I said yes only to be called a cheater. I understand the checks to a degree but dont have the actual person who plays the character as a fake check.",No,None
I'd give this app a 5 star if it wasn't for the Premium characters and how it says rejected when it thinks your cheating. I would also complain about the ads but I don't think there's much point because you won't do anything.,No,None
"It's nice and brings back memories from when i was younger, but sometimes the game says I'm cheating though I was thinking of the person they asked? I just think that's very weird and now I'm at the bottom of the leaderboard again",No,None
Okay this game is really bad. 1: It took forever to load when i first downloaded it. 2: LAGS TOO MUCH. And finally 3: Ads every. Single. Time. I am not downloading this back until it is fixed.,No,None
It is quiet a fun game....and hopefully it really works most of the time.....another good thing about this is that you can play this game with your family and friends to have some fun.ðð But the only problem is the VIP needs. But it's not really a big problem. Nice app. Happy with it.ð,Yes,Humor
because it bloody updated I lost all of my previous scores. this is unacceptable as I had a black award and a platinum award and one of everything. I was proud of that and i trust to get them back but I just guessed the wrong person. then it wouldn't give me the award because it didn't guess it first time. fix it!,No,None
"Lol, you have to pay or watch the add to see the answer in case it's not something obvious. I even tried to watch the add out of curiosity to see the answer but it didn't work. But then it was playing adds between games ð¤·ð»ââï¸",No,None
"Its ok, but I have one problem: Why can't I play offline? I love this but I would love to be able to play without needing internet. Fix this please and i'll rate this five stars. Thanks!",No,None
He could not guess the character. After trying several times he still didnt know. Not upset about it but figured he would know the person after enough guessing and I've lesser known characters be guessed easier,No,None
"''VIP"" Is SO ANNOYING. I can't even watch an AD to get any further. It always says: ""Videos not available."" . ............... . . . Can it be my device or is it game issue? ........................ ðï¸[Sorry for bad english. (If was any mistakes in the text.) ] ð¤",No,None
It always gets it correct. It is like the best mind reader. It mostly gets it incorrect in kids mode for my child.,No,None
It was a good app before but now every time I play it says that you are thinking of a rare character and then I have to see a 30s long unskippable ad .,No,None
"Used to be a really fun app. But now it's quite bad at guessing, and if you pick anyone too obscure it makes you watch an ad before it reveals the guess.",Yes,Humor
"Great game! Quite a few ads, but if you can get past that then I highly recommend it. One question though.. I had a character who you couldn't guess, yet I got no reward, is there a reason for this?",No,None
"Clean up your answers, stop repeating the same questions, and actually make the bot think. I'll tell it that the character doesn't exist and I'll still end up with a youtuber or your husband. Someone should, and could, make a better questionnaire than this.",No,None
"It's a good and reliable game quite enjoyable but i agree with the others, if we can only play in offline because it's really disappointing it would be great i already shared it with my friends but it's getting really boring a lot",Yes,Humor
Okay okay so this is a great game but the ads though i prefer the old version but when you are trying to do something an ad come up then you accidentally answered the wrong question thats what i really hate but great app i recommend it for you,No,None
This app is great but once I enter the app there's thi loading thing that pops up and its 0%-12% and when my phone turns off and turn it on again its back to 0% i suggest you remove that loading thing,No,None

"ok so this games is cool and all but..WHAT IS THE USE OF THE ""VIP MEMBER"" THING? like are you serious?! plus it happens when i play that all of a sudden it stops and show an ad for the vip thing..and when i exit the ad it restartð«",No,None
"The ads are to much every character seems to be a ""rare character"" at this point plus the app uses your data (without permission) its creepy, also you are almost as greedy as lion studios",No,None
This game is good but there are many ads that just exist it doesn't matter if my character was played less than 1k times it doesn't mean you need an ad other than that it's quite good,No,None
Very well made. Theres just one problem. It takes so long to load and it always says that theres a problem every single SECOND I play! It definetley deserved this rating.,No,None
"This is a great app! It shows my characters so easily, but i gave it 4 stars because every time akanator guesses. it puts a bunch of ads, but however this is great!",No,None
"Fix the way points are awarded in this game.If someone is thinking of a character that isnt too well known, why punish the player by not awarding the points and the award when your bad ai guesses wrong the first time. As a result, i will always say the first guess is correct because i wont get points if its wrong",No,None
Whenever I guess a rare character i cannot click watch a video. There is no link there. The only link that works is no thanks. Pretty useless considering the point is to get rare ones,No,None
"I'd give it 5 stars but when I tried to make an account, it said it already has an account with the same email. I don't know how that is possible because it is the first time going on akinator.( Unless someone ACTUALLY has my Email) Besides that, a pretty good game.",No,None
"This game is fun, but I'm being penalized for guessing elusive and hard people. If I land on someone to quickly or easily they reject my idea and make accusations that I'm just trying to scam an award.",Yes,Humor
"I really find it unfair when an answer that's part of a ""validity test"" is the actor that plays the character I was attempting to get. I assumed that it was just how it was entered by the individual who created the character- and therefore shouldn't be penalized for assuming that saying ""yes"" to the actor, as opposed to the character he plays (might I be adding that the picture used was the character from the show) would constituent cheating. ridiculous.",No,None
This game is great and it helps me a lot when I forget my favorite youtubers! but there is a lot loading! and I also lose my all network after I play this game I'll give you 5 stars if you fix these problems!,No,None
I don't know whether this app is a mobile application or a magician who read the mind and correctly guess your character even after if you try to cheat it (ie.by giving one or two answers wrong!!) but as this type of app really existed I will give salute to the app developers who made such a clever software!! 5 star ððððð rating again by me.,No,None
"I'm enjoying playing this game and let him guess the characters I have in mind. Way better if he can't guess it xD However, I hope he could guess more Guardian Tales characters and add an option of adding a pic onto that character or whatever PS: He can't guess Future Princess from Guardian Tales :p",No,None
"Far too many ads, guessing a character is impressive, but an unskippable 15 second ad just for the wrong answer is not worth it.",No,None
It was HORRIBLE it wanted soooooo much data and shared with everyone and for some weird reason it wanted my location like why would an entertainment game need your location the only app I can trust and give my location to is amazon I hate this app even playing with a piece of wood is better than this app,No,None
"Good game, but there's too many rare characters that shouldn't be rare, such as literally any Danganronpa character. If I have to watch an ad just so I can see if it got my character right then have it come out as wrong, there's a problem. I also would like to mention that some information for Byakuya Togami is incorrect (He mentioned that he has siblings and likely a lot of them, and when I looked at the expected answers it said he was an only child).",No,None
"This is a really fun game, most of the questions are mostly a yes, no or don't know question for me. Akinator asks some silly questions too. But really really fun and exciting game. I would say keep up the good work.",Yes,Humor
The app was really good but you can't play it anymore without paying..after letting you watch videos couple of time it asks for money to show you the answer..it's not playable anymore..uninstalled.,No,None
"a good fun app. but if your are playing to get on the leaderboard, where one must make akinator guess the character in the first attempt.. its get irritating over time when the stupid bot wastes questions and repeats questions ...",Yes,Humor
Freakishly accurate and you can earn medals for how good your character is and how hard it is to get. Also you can dress up akinator for how many points you get. Overall this game will really kill time and you have probably seen millions of people on youtube play this,No,None
DO NOT DOWN LOAD THIS APP I DID AND IT WAS ACCESSING MY LOCATION AND TOOK 3G OF MY MOBILE DATA WITHOUT MY PERMISSION ALSO WHEN I TRIED TO GET ON THE APP IT KICKED ME OUT OF IT AND KEPT PLAYING THIS MUSIC EVEN WHEN I WASN'T ON THE APP AND MY PHONE WAS SWITCHED OFF.

"Great game, love that it is up to date and has a lot of things to guess. But one thing is for some reason it won't put me on the leaderboard even if I get a gold, platinum or black.

"Very good game. But it takes time for loading so I kept getting annoyed from that and please remove the long loading ! If you ask me, this is a very very good game. I love this game. ðâ¤",No,None
You cant get all charecters in the daily challenge. It dosent let you. I got 4 out of 5 characters but i also got the fifth character but it was showing it was not on the board but when i checked the next day that was the last charecter. It is a fun game bit has a lot of issues with it,Yes,Humor
I love this game so much it's been correct almost every time I can play this game all day I enjoy this game and I love how when dressing up the Akinator you use coins in wich you get every time you play instead of them being locked or watching an add to get the clothing and there is one free shirt ps. not amy Amy's friend,No,None
!_! this app tricks me everytime a ad goes up it says sorry akinator is shutting down for the next 5 hours and when i go back it said akinator has been removed from your device for not playing for a day its really bad and hate it if they fix the bugs i might like it,No,None

Theres so many adverts and it sometimes doesnt give you an answer and even if you watch a video for it. I hate it but because it doesnt know the most popular games and kid shows.,No,None
"i know this a app but this is cursed its envolves alot of creepy stuff and this app records and hears everything you say and the fact that it can READ YOUR MIND is just the starting. so if you are seeing this, DO NOT DOWNLOAD you could get hacked or even worse track your location, i know this alot of people will say its a lie but its not belive me or you might be next...",No,None

"Will ask you the same questions they've just asked you multiple time and gives you characters that have traits he asked you about and have blatantly said no to, plus for some reason you can only get the rewards for saying characters if he guessed them on his first try which is insanely counterintuitive considering the rewards are based of how rare the characters are to be guessed therefore how difficult it is for him to guess them, don't waste your time on this trash",Yes,Passive-Aggression

"Neat gimmick, horrible execution. This is one of the WORST aged snippets of the past decade, and it's entirely the fault of the creators. Let's pretend that dressing your genie as a stereotype of Native Americans, complete with a war bonnet is fine.

"So this is a pretty fun guessing game that can be played with friends and family and offer a good deal of enjoyment as you try to have the Genie guess who you are thinking of. My only complaints is if you are thinking of someone the Genie hasn't heard of or happen to stump the Genie you get nothing from it and makes it seem like it's your fault. Even if you enter information to help add someone in. I would also like to know what makes a character a ""VIP"" character and prompt a video.",Yes,Humor

I gave three stars because whenever I leave the app then I have to start all over again. Otherwise it's a nice app,No,None
this app is AMAZING it guesses your chareter 90/100 percent. how it works is your think of someone or a cartoon ( remeber it doesnt have to be alive) then akanator asks questions and trys to guess your charecter if he doesnt you can contiune or tell him your charecter. I defiently recommend becuase you also can get rewards too.,Yes,Flattery
its awasome but everytime i get close to winning it always says to start a new game n if i click to continue the game it lagges not fair bro not fair ðððð,No,None
"Great app! I use this to mess with my friends and family. But, the reason my rating is 4 stars is that there are way too many ads!! I hate that if I want to change a drink, I HAVE TO WATCH AN AD! This has gone out of control. Back then, this game had a fair amount of ads, but now? It's out of control. Another feature I would love is minigames. Also, please make it so that the fruit float so it is more realistic. Overall, 4 stars. Great way to enterain! But please remove some of the ads. Bye! ð",No,None
"Pretty drink but way too many ads. I opened the game for the first time after downloading and before I could do anything, there was an ad. I pressed the play button, ad. I chose a drink, ad. Pushed the back button to choose another drink, ad. Choose a drink, ad. Way too many ads. It makes the app so much less functional.",Yes,Humor
"Honestly I like this app, but the advertisements are just out of control. Literally out of control. Not only are they too intrusive, but they're loud and obnoxious!! You can't even simply navigate the app without being taxed 10 seconds with an obnoxious ad. These are the things that make me NOT want to support the developer. ""Select tones already on device"" should NOT have an ad barrier!!!!! >: (",No,None
"Um it's really fun and all but when it caught changing the drinks and picking other drinks that add starts coming in... Everything is I really love the app it's just the ads. Okay the eyes has gone out of control like every time I want to change a simple drink and add comes up you don't know how annoying that is. A beautiful star but once the ads start coming down then, I will give it a five star! Four stars are good enough right? Yes it is so please fix the ads.. it's kind of really annoying.",Yes,Humor
This app is terrible! All the drink do is just move the surface of the water around in a straight line of bubbles! It's not like the ads at all! And speaking of ads. This game has so many you can even count them. I turn on the game BOOM ad. That one finishes.. BOOM another one. And only then can you play the game. I thought this would be a fun and relaxing but it isnt!,Yes,Irony
"This is a pretty fun game, good for pranking your friends and stuff. I dont like how many ads there is and then the icon at the top of the screen to change drinks kind of annoys me because it makes it look unreal at times, I do love that you can put in your own ingredients and test our your own drinks! â­ â­ â­â­",Yes,Humor
This app is horrible I couldn't even use it because it would show an ad after ad I didn't even get the chance to use it because after every click of me exiting out of the ad a new one would pop up. Can u please try to fix this. Thanks.,No,None
This game is good but if u play this game for a long time u will surely get bored ð so I request to add a few more features to this game. There is another problem that after every drinking there is a ad even if I switch of the internet ads are shown so please reduce the number of ads otherwise I will uninstall this game.,No,None
First this just looks like a picture of a drink that disappears as you fake drink it. They didn't even try to make the ice or liquid look real . Second after opening the app you will have to watch an ad (no problem it's a free app) but then there is no exit from the Pay-wall that follows it and covers they keys to use the app. You have to keep restarting the app and watch more ads until you can see just enough around the pay-wall to press the button. Forget it it's now on my uninstalled list.,No,None
"Hi, can you please get rid of the forced ads? They're pretty frustrating. I opened the app and got an ad, then clicked on one of the drinks that I liked the look of and BOOM, another ad. It also lags a lot but I just got a new, really good phone for Christmas, so I don't understand why it's lagging? I don't think it should unless this is just the app. The rest of the game looks quite good and fun to use but the adverts and lag ruined it a bit ð. Thanks for reading my review, enjoy your day. Bye",Yes,Humor
"This app is amazing but there is only one problem, there's too many adds I give a 4 star rating because it puts the same ad I've watched every single time I pick a drink. Yet it still comes to where it did the same ad over and over againð I like it but I didn't want to see all the ads I've watched over and over. GoodBye!ð",Yes,Flattery
"Cool game, but there is 2 problems. 1 - there is no updates and 2 - when I open the app a ad pops up and after the ad there is another ad which pops up on the screen and is on the ""play"" button so I can't play the game.",No,None
"This game is really fun and great! Just a few requests, maybe lessen the ads? I understand that you people who made the game need money, but the amount of ads are driving me crazy!!! (I've read the other reviews, they've got the same problem!) Well that's all I have to say, Thank you so much for creating this game and working hard on it. :) Btw, happy new year!!!! â¤ï¸",Yes,Humor
This is such a great pranking game:D. You can pretend you are actually drinking from a glass cup only if you allowed the camera on. I actually enjoyed this but the thing is that the drink is laggy. When you shake the drink or something it kinda freezes. I'm pretty sure it wasn't my phone because its kinda new and I don't know if this is happening to other people. But it doesn't lag much. There isn't even much ads. Recommendedð,No,None
Well the look is good. But realism is lacking. I turn my phone upside down and the drink drain out in like 10 seconds. Real water will be gone in like half second. Oke I know there might be differences but at least try to make the drink runs out faster with more tilting angle.,No,None
"The apps main menu's music would randomly go off on my phone even when it hadn't been accessed in some time. This was an app my kid downlaoded but after finding out it also has access to my camera when it doesn't need to, I uninstalled it. To me this is too suspicious to keep around.",No,None
"Actually unreal how retarded this is XD I open the app, immediately get an ad for the same slime game every time, and then, upon closing that ad, I get one for Google Pay. And this one, I cannot close. There is no X button to close it, installing Google Pay doesn't work, pushing the back button doesn't even work. It just closes the app.",No,None
Used to be a fun game I had downloaded it for my little brother but I deleted it because of all the ads they suddenly put in and all the fruits are locked now and the only way to unlock it is to watch more ads it even pops up ads when you dont even click anything. Not playable there are so many ads:/,Yes,Humor
"This app lets you create your own drink and add fruit of your choice to it. ð¹ððððð Has nice relaxing music playing in the background. ð¶ð¶ The drink moves as you move your phone, just like it would inside a glassð±ð¥¤ and the fruit bounces inside in a realistic way. You can ""drink"" it, than ""refill"" your ""glass"". You have to watch an add to unlock each fruit, and to change drink type, but that's OK. It's a nice and creative idea. ðð¥¤ðð",No,None
This game is just very exiting. And it may contain ads but it is okay and I do really not care that the ads might just pop-up out of nowhere. Super cool and also very refreshing and relaxing. I feel like I am really drinking my drinks from the phone. Super awesome!!!ððð,Yes,Humor
"This game is great, but i have two things, one of them is not really 'a problem' but it can have an update, though both need an update 1. The icon that lets you add ice, strawberries and stuff, you can do an update that if you double click that icon it dissapears so that when you are joking around it would look real 2. PLEASE STOP THE ADDS!! I am sick of those adds. Its like, they are EVERY WHERE! first when i opened the game, and before i could do anything add. So PLEASE.",No,None
I'm telling you it would have been a five-star if there weren't so many ads like the amount of ads is just crazy but I really really love this app and it's so fun there's a little problem when you click on icon I thought it would let you change it it's just toppings for your drink,Yes,Humor
"It's great and all, but it's also a bit confusing to use. For an example, the texture of the drink. I would like it if the drink was more liquidy like a actual drink. And I don't get where you're supposed to put your mouth at to pretend to drink the drink. I would've gave 5 stars if the app was much more improved than this.",No,None
K so I just read a review saying that you can turn flight mode on to rid the ads so I'm fine with this game no issues perfect.ðoh yeah can you still make the sound affects more realistic plsðoh my fave drink is probably that one with a little bit of pink at the bottom then red in middle and then the top has blue mixed with a little bit of black it's probe fave forever,No,None
"People play games and enjoy a lot. Some games are boring ðð. This game go in very very good games team. Giving it 4 stars, not 5 because of bad and boring adds!! I hate that adds. Now but I like it but there will the time in which I will hate this app. If you want that I don't get bore from this game, pls remove adds. I know that you want money and I am also not saying that remove all adds. I am just saying that pls do that if we are playing game for 10 minutes then only 3 adds come in time!!!",No,None
I love to drink it good and never ever delete this. I'm sorry my manners were gone. There's this neighbor who has this game and I wanted to download this so badly. Then the next morning I woke up and it was on my phone. Can you believe that mean like that is so weird. I will never stop playing this ever. So I guess I am talking way to much. But I will talk even more! I gave it five for 2 reasons it is so realistic and reason 2. Its a little bit stupid sorry but its true! I hope you enjoy this,No,None
Pretty good for a PHONE. I give it two stars because it at least opens for me ( I'm on a tablet ) Hope this review was helpful. The major problem is that irritataing sign when you start the app and the out- of -control ads. ð¤ð¤ðð,No,None
"first of all, the drinks in game dont move realistically. The top of the drink is always a straight line when you move it. Asking developers to make the top of drinks to be more wavy and not so straight. second of all, at start of game u can only have ice to put on ur drink. You have to play althroughout the game to unlock other toppings. U can only put in four fruits, which is really disapointing. i had to go through 2 ads before i even tried the drinks. Theres like one ad a drink. 1 star.",No,None
"It a wonderful app and it's good for a wallpaper i love it. It is a creative description and i think it needs more creativity and design. And also some development in the app. I like it but I have this feeling that it has one wallpaper. And am an American and I don't see things the way Nigeria sees things I will just say this app is sick don't take the word sick as a curse its a compliment. Thank you I hope to see some development next year, and thank you once again for bringing this app.",No,None
"This has GOT to be the best tasting drinking app out there! Each drink was cultivated by a 5-star chef just for you, and refills are on the house! Best part about it, you literally can't get drunk! It makes you feel like Captain America! I would definitely recommend this app to anyone hanging out with a group of friends late on a Friday night with nothing better to do!",No,None
"This game is fun but every time I drink something it starts going out the other end, then I put my mouth to that end but It just goes the other end again. I'm on Samsung so I don't know if it's just the device. But I like the game because I prank my family a lot and they think it's funny. Please improve on that problem and the game will be perfect. Thanks!",Yes,Humor
"This app is great! I have been struggling with alchoholism for a few years now, but after finding this appðð life saver. I no longer struggle with my original addiction, but with what has been diagnosed as virtual alchoholism! The ads really help me limit how many drinks I have per day. On the bright side at least the virtual alchohol has no affect on my liver! Thank you so much to the creators this has been a life saver!ð",No,None
"Great app overall. What you guys should do is make different backgrounds, and put a background on the camera on the front of your phone. It would make it more realistic wherever you are virtually drinking the beverage.",No,None
"I enjoy the game. Mabye I wouldn't play it for fun, but if I am bored (Rarely) I would go to this game. I do not spend more time in this app than expected, but it's a working progress. The app does not let me watch offline, I have to be on the game or if I am distracted it kicks me out. The app does have User Reviews, but I think it has too many ads. I reccomend the gameâ¤",Yes,Humor
"This app is fun, but there are WAY TO MANY ADS. I havent really checked out the app that much, but I think there is a *Remove ads* button. If there isnt, I would like it if you guys could so there is no apps. Still very good.",Yes,Humor
"Best game everseen .... To fresh my mind after study ,I used to have a drink and this drink made me full of energy. Will recommend this app for all the teenagers . Very better than free fire or pubg . Plz make such an app for drinking beer or wine also . Really my stomach become full after drinking a lot of drinks. Really , i can't express my feelings for this aap in words or letters",No,None
I would have rated it five stars if it wasn't rated mature 17+. Good app anyways. It looks so real. The liquid goes away like it's in your mouth. Amazing app. Also four stars because ads pop up every time you press a button that isn't selecting customization.,Yes,Flattery
"it's awesome, there are many options and I can choose my chilling cocktail. during summer morning when I want to have my chilling glass but it's not possible at the moment,. It makes me feel that I am really having my chilling glass of cocktail. and I can add ice cubes and fruits in my cocktail. I love the filling sound and the ending sound when the cocktail is finished. I loved it and recommend others to buy this game, u won't regret.",Yes,Humor
"this is a amazing app! You should download this app you can shock every one :) and like other downloaders are facing many adds l don't think that there are many adds :????ðð",Yes,Flattery
"Way to many ads so I can't have fun all day like it says good music, cool drinking vibes but I'll have to bring my five star rating down to a 3 star rating, all because of the adsð¥",Yes,Humor
"Before you use this useless app, you have to read dozen pages of terms & agree to everything including giving excess to all the files,photos,videos on your phone to use them as they pleased, it's amazing how people agree to these conditions & its even more amazing that Google let them have control of all these personal information when there is no need, THANK YOU Google, GOOD JOB PROTECTING YOUR USERS. Also they state your personal information is send to China",Yes,Flattery
"Its really fun tho.there are many people's that say the ads are bla bla.but the ads are not breaking the game.even i drink and ads on it i don't care if there are many ads.its okay.i fell like a'm on the beach and like a cool place.i really really like it.i unlock all the fruits and use the ads to unlock the fruits.i rate it 5 because its fun,relaxing and enjoying.even i don't have wifi its nothing wrong its the same!.ð",Yes,Humor
This is an amazing game!!!!!!! I like all the different types of drinks .it felt so real !âºðThe reasoning giving it a 4ððððis because ... It kinda glitch when I tilt it it little bit stops . Other than that u can download this game and it's actually just amazing. I made my friends believe that this is a bottle disguised as a phone!!!ðððððð,Yes,Flattery
Honestly this app is really good! I rated it a five stars because it's good but a 1 star for the game I like the drinks!

Super cool app I really like this app you get to choose your own little 'drink' and you can add different things to the 'drink' too I would recommend if you are board and you want to do something a little weird. ð,No,None
This app super cool and I think it's so fun and creative too bad you can't actually forget you can just tell your phone and it makes it look like you're drinking it I did a video once and it looked amazing I like how many things you can put in you can put it strawberries blueberries you could make it blue like water or colored like soda it's really fun to just play with and I would recommend this app to anyone that is it to creative thinks I think this is so fun.,Yes,Humor
Really really REALLY COOL GAMEð When I downloaded this game I played it with my cousin and we pretended we were ordering drinks and we loved itð. I love that it looks like you are actually drinking out of the phone. My cousin thinks it is really cool and is like a drink shop. I think people should play this brilliant game because this is a really cool game. This game has loads of drinks to choose from so downloade this game its awesome ð.,Yes,Humor
The app would randomly start playing music on my phone like the app was open and running... but it wasn't. Even restarting my phone wouldn't stop the music.,No,None
"This is a great app because of how cool the ""drinking"" feature is, but I only rated it 4 stars because I think that the other toppings (fruit and stuff) should also float. Otherwise, this is really great!",No,None
I can't even get to the main menu because they're ads taking up 80% of the screen and I can't even see the buttons with the giant ad that I can't get rid of,No,None
It looks like a wall papper but its not and it does need to be more liqudly. And it needs to not have a lot of ads most of the time it is ads if i chose the name it would be called ads forever. But fix all of these ill think about makeing this a 5 star,No,None
"This is a fun game, but the ads, are a little too much, and you can easily get bored. But I still think its satisfying and I still always play it in my free time. :)",Yes,Humor
"I LOVE THE GAME but the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the game can get very boring now, but overall the game is great!",No,None
"IDrink is... Not great. When I downloaded it, tilting the screen didn't make the liquid move. The only reason this isn't a one star review is the fruit/ice button worked fine. Also the liquid did look fizzy.",No,None
"I had downloaded it, and before I gave it any use tiktok/likee kept popping up after I tried to log out and back in. This is a problem that needs to be fixed, and the ads that have not included a button/symbol to decline.",No,None
I love this ad it's really cool and it's very satisfying too I think you should download it ,No,None
This is a fun little app its really good it has ads and sometimes more ads then other times the quality is good not great but its still fun this app gets boring after a while but just don't use it all the time recommend for ages 10 and under,Yes,Humor

Thank u for your precious time reading this!!!,Yes,Humor
This game is usually super fun but when I downloaded it before there were barely any ads now they are a bunch of ads I got onto the app and a ad popped up right in my face immediately and now you have to watch ads to get the fruit for the drinks please fix.,Yes,Humor
I love this game. But I give 4 stars only for this game. because this game was many ads this is only 1 problem yet. please solve this problem then no problem yet. I select a normal juice then the ads started. So I cannot give 5 stars to this game. Byðð,No,None

I don't remember downloading it but it its in my recent downloads. I did see it on my daughter's phone. So far the thumb isn't inviting alcohol use lol. Please stop shared ad experience in group contacts or family groups make that default when you press the i agree to the terms policy more light needs to shed on that.,No,None

"This is the best thing I've ever downloaded, the graphics is astounding and the gameplay is smooth, the map is really massive and there's so much to do, I met a lot of friends who helped me along my journey in the game, I didn't encounter any bugs or glitches, just one thing tho, please add more outfits to the game, oh and the boss at the top of tower is really hard to beat unless you have that weapon that has only 0.00001% of acquiring which is a huge bummer, please make it easier to acquire.",No,None
"I would give it a five star rating but the game lags a lot and it keeps deleting my saved file, I'd get past the tutorial and it would crash. Game is very beautiful don't get me wrong, especially it being on mobile blows my mind but it's just there's a few things they need to work on! Hopefully they fix them because I'd love to see where this game goes in the future!",No,None
"Great game! The graphics are pretty nice.. but I have noticed a game breaking glitch, if you shake the screen, there will be a box that says ""69"" and a text box. If you type in it, the game will close itself and when you open, every number is a 69 spam. But they have fixed this in an update, thank god! Also, soundtrack is very nice.",No,None
"OK. So here's mine... Tried to install it few times, it took times, several times. Even have to move to gain more signal, but it didn't. Tried restarting it, still none. Then, after a while, found something useful. At last, after a few moments, it freed me from boresome. Its amazing how a great featire pack into just a few megs. It even gave me free wallpaper. Thumbs up.",Yes,Flattery
"Awesome app. It's very entertaining and, nicely designed. The buttons in the game are not to small and not to large. The buttons are also nice colors. There is a part in the game that is so awesome and amazing that I fell off my chair while playing it at work, there is a word on screen that says âNothingâ first of all, the grammer is correct and second of all, the font is nice. The color (Which is black) is a great color choice. Best game in app history.",Yes,Humor
I'd say the best mobile game out there. In my personal experience it's very inspirational and filled with goofy characters. I've always dreamed of making a game one day and it's inspiring to see that. The graphics are smooth and do much to do! I'd consider installing.!,No,None
"Amazing and immersive graphics. I'm having a hard time with level 4, but at least I got the Commodore's key so I can at least get off the ship. The soundtrack to this game really makes it hard to put down. Any truth about this game coming to Xbox or PS?",Yes,Flattery
"I will admit, at first I didn't understand the hype - but once the world opened up, it floored me. I was overwhelmed with splendor. It was almost too much to take in at first, but once I steadied my shaken mental fortitude enough to muster a clammy grasp on this masterpiece, everything just came together. Now I am ripping through the paces with complete immersion, completely enveloped in what is quite possibly the greatest game of the decade. GOTY for sure.",No,None
"it's a great game! very interactive and there's lots to do. there's a few glitches with furniture placing although they aren't a big deal. farming monsters is easy but it's hard to get past the chimera boss, i think you have to make the boss fight easier. even with the S rank weapons that i have it's still a challenging boss to beat. i also love the soundtrack especially the soundtrack for the cherry blossom biome. i recommend this game to everyone!",No,None
"This game is incredible. The graphics are stunning. I also like character development and the soundtrack. I downloaded it not that long ago, but I'm getting close to the boss. The only thing I'd reccomend is making the loading screen faster.",Yes,Flattery
"I remember this app being really good, there was no icon, no name, invisible on the desktop and when you opened it, it was completely black, truly like you opened nothing. They probably changed it because you likely couldn't publish something that was invisible, but I miss this version. But this current one is fine I guess.",No,None
"Gorgeous, brilliant, amazing, this is one of the best app out there, it easy to use and really useful, whenever i feel bad i just open this and chill, really recommend The color of the background just blend perfectly together with the black front making a breath taking view, there are only one word for the graphic and music â¨ P E R F E C T I O Nâ¨",Yes,Flattery
"This is probably the best game anyone will ever play. There is absolutely no word to describe this. Graphics are just striking and the ambience is very sensational, its as if you are in the game itself. The plot structure and the way events unfold are just remarkable! The characters are well-built. This deserves more awards and more players. Great job dev",No,None
This game is so great the map is so big and the graphics are next level. Although there is a huge bug which makes the game crash when you play it for too long. Me and my friends are playing this game for 24x7 multiplayer,No,None
"Hey hey! I deleted my almost a year old review (minus 14 days but who's counting) To say that over this year, I have almost finished the game! There is one glitch I have come across though... When you get to world 3629 and she dyes her hair (that level) it looks like her finger is a different color then the rest of her body. Not realistic like every single other thing. Anywho... Great game! 5 stars. Edit: the ""glitch"" was part of the story line. Takes a while to load still tho...",No,None
"Great but for some reason every time I get to w35, the game crashes and I have to go the last checkpoint which was 2 levels ago, I hope this gets fixed. Another thing, I chose the bone king perk and for some reason sometimes I can't summon the skeleton minions, I made sure I had full Mana but it still doesn't work half the time. Great but this rating will remain 4 stars untill the bug is fixed",No,None
This is the most fun experience I had in a app the story straight down to the action and weapons and characters I wish it was a little more complex though like try adding puzzels to get to the boss room or add more characters it has a massive map a bunch of side missions and tons of npcs best app ever.,Yes,Humor
This game is amazing. It gas a lot of types of characters to choose from. The graphics are real smooth too. There are so many quest. This game really keeps you busy. It's the perfect game to play when you are bored. Great work!,Yes,Flattery
"This game is amazing! Outstanding graphics, extremely fun, and I will never get tired of it! I reccomend you to download this app. Although there are a few glitches, it is very fun to play and neverending joy! The map is huge! Good gameplay mechanics too! This is the best game I have ever seen in my entire life!",Yes,Humor
"Oh my this app is amazing! The characters are perfect and the gameplay is simple. The storyline is excellent all while taking little to no space at all in your phone. I spend HOURS on this game, super fun to play!",Yes,Humor
"This app is such a addiction that I didn't mind breaking 3 phones while shaking the phones with all vigour and strength. The app opend a window though small but fulfilling enough to summarize the entire universe for me. I am convinced that if there would something better built... ever, then it will be against the God's will after they have lost all powers. So go ahead and install this app and rise and explore unknowns beyond the boundaries of realm or powerful oceans of time.",No,None
"One of the best apps I have seen in my entire life. Just a swipe or a tap is so enlightening. It helps so much in doing nothing. If it doesn't work initially, just shake your phone untill it changes screen. Cheers!",No,None
"It says that it does nothing but when I opened the app in the dark, my screen started working as a flashlight which helped me get out of the bedroom without tripping over something so the app does nothing is actually a false claim. Totally disappointed but I'll still drop 5 stars because I have high expectations from the developers.",Yes,Self-Deprecation
"Well, sorry for my bad rating back ago Now i get the point of this app, It was useful, and not useless, the reason is, it might confuse you for the first time, but if you work harder, It will bring a fortune, yes, a fortune Want to know why? It reveals a twisting truth and a great complexing story, For the first glance, It just show some blank screen, trust me, If you stay longer, The actual story began, The marvelous graphics is great, It was realistic like the real world, 101/10",No,None
"This app is simply beautiful, it makes you realise that we are just a tiny microscope spec floating in the air resting on a flower its wonderful I would one hundred dollars pay or more!
