"Just plain bad. The premise is unique, so terrible trying to be ""not like the other games"". No ads, so of course it's awful because I can't watch my precious ads. It provides a challenge, which is completely heinous because I need everything handed to me. One good thing about it though is that there's no way to get back to the menu when you play. But that doesn't take away from the absolute awfulness of this game. DO NOT PLAY!!!",Yes,Irony,
"I barely write reviews, but I had to on this one because it was absolutely AWFUL. There are no ads which is absolutely terrible I like my games all ad and no game. The gameplay is absolutely terrible, it's easy to get and very fun. The menu is easy to navigate which is uncalled for and extremely frustrating. If I could I would rate it 0 stars.",Yes,Irony,
"It was a mess. My eyes hurt after playing the game because eye-straining colors with poor interface. It is not enjoyable to begin, it greatly lacks in background design and does not even have an effects. It did not even have an instruction or gameplay leaving me clueless on how the game works. Overall, it was a total eyesore. But I am sure that it will improve just a bit more motivation to plan.",Yes,Humor,
"Not enough ads. This is driving me insane! Like, you want to make money from this, right? There's no popup ads or forced ads. All there is is some lousy ads at the bottom of the screen. Like get this, they still let you enjoy a full gaming experience while the ads are displayed. Ugh! One star! Terrible!",Yes,Irony,
I am disappointed. The game does not have ads. Ads are the whole point of games. They are what stops you in the middle of a game. Ads are enjoyable to watch. Ads are awesome. Another bad thing about this horrible app is its gameplay. It was tremendously hard! I want to win a game instantly. WORST APP EVER! If I could give this trash 0 stars I definitely would.,Yes,Humor,
"I would rate this 0 stars if I could! I has no ads! How can I enjoy something if it has no ads! It also has an enjoyable game, which sucks because I like it! I hate liking things! I also hate how it has one of the most creative goals. That doesn't irritate me, which irritates me, because I like being irritated, but not in this scenario! 1 star!!!",Yes,Humor,
"One star, it was boring and you don't expect much from it, except being the worst game ever. Game needed more features, at least add more mods to keep it interestingly longer. It also needs to change that sound effect when you get a right answer, I felt like I was bar-code scanning items in a grocery store.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Awful, this app is horrible. it didnt have ANY ads, which is basically the point of games. You really have to work and think to get score, which I think ruins all games, as I like things to be handed to me from the start. I don't recomend this app to anyone. I cant believe anyone could even possible make such a bad game.",Yes,Irony,
"What I think about this game is that it really needs a lot of improvements especially in the style, gameplay and game design. There are no enjoyable moment within the game. It is so plain and the colors of the shape are eye straining. It could be improved with the design of how the shapes float and with the interactivity of the buttons, maybe a more pleasing style for the eye. It needs more challenges, difficulties, and maybe another level for the players to enioy. And also a pause button.",Yes,Humor,
"The only good thing I can say about this game is that the challenge was enjoyable, otherwise, it was painful. The interface does not help in giving cues on what it is about and uses eye straining colors. There are no instructions. Gameplay-wise it similar it is to rhythm-based games. Flow of incoming blocks vary in speed and difficulty becomes a headache to catch up to. Overall, despite its flaws, it was fun to play. Would recommend to other people to suffer like I did. (this is for school btw)",Yes,Humor,
"I HATE THIS GAME!!! I can't watch my ads! Like seriously.. Ã°ÂÂÂ© worst game ever. Also, the only thing I love about it is that it calls me a loser!! I love it so much! But there's no way to go back to the main menu... AMAZING but then when you get to it... IYS EDUCATIONAL bleckkk ew nastayy I hate this game so much and please download tho...",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"The game suggested to give itself only a star so I rated it with only one star. The game gmhas potential, it is challenging yet fun. The downside was the design of the title page and ui. The simplicity of the design during the game was alright because it chellanges the player with the similarities of the tile shapes. Overall, it was a fun game to play.",Yes,Humor,
"The game is thrilling but gives nausea later on as you keep chasing the blocks with your eyes and at the same time, thinking if you've got the right color. But all in all, this game has potential to improve in many areas. Keep annoying your players while giving fun!",Yes,Humor,
"This game is absolute GARBAGE. I mean, how can I enjoy a game when it has no ads?! And heck, even the game itself is trash. It took me 3 seconds to understand it, that is way to long for my standards. And the fact that it's fun isn't even the worst part. The worst part is the fact that it's unique. How dare the devs make a game with no ads AND make a fun and addictive game! I can't believe I even bothered to install this price of poop.",Yes,Irony,
"What is this? You simply have a fun game with no ads. Despicable. These creators are just begging for a one star review with how bad this app is. How am I supposed to enjoy my ads with no ads. The fact that it is fun and somewhat challenging... Disgusting. It even requires me to use my brain. Only a demonic creature bent on mass destruction could have come up with something so awful. I'm going back to play evil sponge neighbor find the secrets. Plenty of ads, ans no thinkinf needed. L + Ratio.",Yes,Irony,
This is the worst game in the history of worst games. 1. It has NO ADS can't enjoy anything without ads popping up every 30 seconds. And 2. ITS SO COMPLICATED you tap squares make it easier!!,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Just plain bad. Theres no top-tier ads for me to find new, better games. It's just white with flashing colors, completely pointless. I don't understand who would come up with such a horrible idea for a game. You know what, I hate this game so much, that I'll even tell my grandmother to give this game one star. Absolute trash. If I could give 0 stars, I would.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Awful. 3 columns and colors. I am daltonic, so this game is the worst thing I ever saw. Althrough, I can give it a good rating: they helped me to remind my life situation that I messed up. No ads, but this can be consumed, that is great, that you learned how to hide them. All wrong answers were an Ads. I knew it. ONe S ta R",Yes,Irony,
"Worst game ever. The game is engaging, which is bad because i missed a meeting, it insults me when i fail, which reminds me of my ex-wife, Sharon, it lets me ay a GAME (can you belive it? It LETS me play a game?) I was expecting a challenge to get onto the game but nope! Too easy! Oh but the ads are the worst, where are my precious,beautiful,wonderful ads?? Im heartbroken",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This app is ridiculous! The game is actually challenging, and I can't believe how little there are ads in this! I can't live without my precious ads! This is a horrible app. The only good thing about it is there's not more then one of those terrible games in the app!",Yes,Irony,
This game was enjoyable even though i didnt know what to do first or how the game works. Its quite challenging but sometimes the colors are not being tapped and missed it. Add designs to the game and use other colors or change the background that would fit for the game.,Yes,Humor,
"The reason why the game is called one of the worst is because of the lack of instructions on how the game works. As I played it, I have no idea on what I am doing because the buttons also dont have interaction with the players in clicking it. As I got to play it in my third try, I was able to get the game and got 920 points. It is boring because as you progress, you do not level up and there's no certain effect with getting a high point in the game. The game itself makes no sense.Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Worst game ever. They have the audacity to make it a simple and nice enjoyable game I can quickly play while I'm bored. I'm baffled at the thought that they actually don't stop my game to display ads like, I wanna see ads, that's like a big reason I played the game! Unenjoyable. I recommend rating it a 1 star to warn other people",Yes,Humor,
"The app deserves its one star rating because the app is not enjoyable and it does not have anything most user/players would be interested in and most importantly, the interface is not friendly. It would've been better if the developer added challenges and rewards or user customization for the players to put effort in playing the game.",Yes,Humor,
It was a fun game though it needs improvement. The game does not have an end unless you will tap the wrong rectangle to lose lives. Maybe you can add other features like scoreboard so that the player can have a sense of accomplishment when their names appear in it. This game is good for those who are looking for a game to cure their boredom but for me I do not think that I will play this daily. You can do better.,Yes,Humor,
"If only I could rate this 0 stars, first of all the game is sooo harddd like why do that, my highest score is only 790. Second of all, add some ads! Like my goal was to watch ads like tv. But you gave me work. And last of all, the words that you say are encouraging like, how dare you be nice to me. Do better with yourself. I can't believe this. Uninstalled immediately.",Yes,Irony,
"Absolutely terrible. Awful concept, and as if it couldn't get any worse, there aren't any ads. I think everyone can agree that the best games always force you to watch 30 second ads after every round. There simply isn't a word in the English language that can accurately express my disappointment.",Yes,Irony,
"This game is terrible! Trying to be quirky and not like other games. Absolutely NO ads which is so annoying, interesting mini games that suck, and no payment requirements! Please add these things!",Yes,Irony,
"Ugh, if I could give this 0 stars I would! This game sucks! It doesnt have any ads which is outrageous, every game should have an ad with every click they are very enjoyable. And the game itself makes no sense! Not to mention it lowers your self esteem so much! I lost at it's impossible game and it called me a loser! Just like my ex husband. I'm not the loser Carl, you are! These remarks DONT Effect me... but it could really hurt someones feelings. Do not download.",Yes,Humor,
"There's not even a single ad popped up, usually fun games should have ads, on this game, not a single ad appeared, it's so horrible, this is the worst game I've ever played. Ever.",Yes,Humor,
"literally the worst app I've ever played. no ads either?? you need at LEAST 3 ads every 10 seconds! it's super hard to play too. I'm just mad that the 'game' doesn't have any subscription things I could buy for $100 a month! Ã°ÂÂÂ Uninstalling right now, 1 star! (I'm kidding ofc)",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This app is the worst. Not only is there no ads, but it's super complicated. I mean, TAPPING SQUARES?! Why can't you make things more simple? I thought this was gonna be a fun little game but IT IS NOT! How DARE they try to make me use 2 brain cells to play this game. UNBELIEVABLE! I would NEVER recommend this game! How can I enjoy a game without a 30 second unskippable ad every 2 seconds?! In short, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, and if you do, rate it 1 star because it is TERRIBLE!!!",Yes,Irony,
The worst game in existence! It has 0 ads! We all know the best games have 250 ads every level! The game doesn't glitch at all AND when I press the color the beep comes when I touch the color like WHAT! Only 5 star games glitch and respond 1 minute after! DO NOT GET IT! (All jokes aside this is a pretty cool game),Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Wow, what a dumpster fire. Controls are a mess and the boxes are as laggy and slow as my grandma with dementia. The WORST. GAME. EVER. My friend showed me this game and installed it thinking its going to be great but only to be met with disappointment. I never talked to that """"friend"""" ever again. So thanks, ""GAME"". Maybe develop something better next time morons.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This app is the WORST! It had no ads and the ads in mobile games are my LIFE! It actually presented a challenge, and nurtured my brain, but I need everything handed to me on a silver platter. 1/10 would not recommend (this is a good game)",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"* Download time: Terrible download. It took about 10-15 seconds...Insain! * ""Help"" Screen: Atrocious Ã°ÂÂÂ£ AND Absolutely ** No Help at ALL! In fact, it was so bad I couldn't locate it! Ã°ÂÂÂ * Game Playability: Painfully Alarming! It made me feel like a complete dunce! Once I got the 'hang of it' I got tired and quit. It said I was 120 points away from the top score of 1760. Who cares? Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Irony,
"This game is outright trash thank you the creator of this app of making it more worse by the way it ain't pointless to install because you get what you get with this app just look at the title and you know what this app is all about. I forgot to tell you that your really "" good"" at the guitar it is better than anything I have ever heard even mirrors will love it . Why aren't there any ads I love adds I'm "" patient"" at all times . Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"One of the worst games ever in my life. First of all,it has no ads. How can I enjoy this game if I can't watch my ads!? Also the game of clicking squares is horrible. Why would anyone play this horrible game? Give me one reason why I would give this another measly star. Even games that also have one star I would give another star because it is MUCH more better than this. My final thought is that you should NEVER get this game.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Worst app ever. It's ad free, which is really frustrating. I want ads every five seconds that plaster my screen. The support team is quick to respond and is kind and helpful, which really grinds my gears, why would you ever help users!? If I could rate zero stars I sure would.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"My otherdimensional friend downloaded this app as he was finding a decent time-waster. A few moments after, I saw him in his ""low-power"" form. I decided to find out what happened and his travelling device was on cooldown. He told me that he didn't travel, yet it was suddenly on cooldown. I decided to delete the app and the cooldown finally counted down. I only downloaded this app to give a 1 star rating. Bye. Edit: Actually tried it. Got only Tik-tok ads for the last hour. WORST APP EVER.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"So bad Ã°ÂÂÂAbsolutely zero ads, ZERO ADS I NEED ADS TO LIVE HOW CAN A MOBILE GAME HAVE ZERO ADS, an absolute disgrace. I expect to have advertisement and in app purchases shoved down my throat it's a mobile game after all. Other than that it is awful and garbage and the people who made should be sentenced to death.",Yes,Irony,
It absolutely sucks a game with no ads I need ads to live. And everything is so black and dark it's so boring. The color of this app is shows my mood right now. Very unacceptable. Even when you're doing something fun and you're playing this game it's so boring.,Yes,Humor,
Honestly was great till I found out it was pay to win and full of reused assets from the previous game. I can't believe how lazy and buggy this game is from the first one. It is mindblowing how many microtransactions you can put in one menu. Story is too politcal also. I bought the collectors edition and still haven't received my One Star Bag and still no refund. Im frustrated and heartbroken that this studio has strayed so far from the light.,Yes,Irony,
"When I downloaded I thought ""It'll be a fun game!"" NO. First off, there are NO ADS!!! I need ads to live! I actually had to pay FOR ads! And then, the game hacked into the government's supercomputer, and nuked me. I'm on a tropical island surrounded by hula dancers where the sun never sets right now.",Yes,Humor,
"Unnaccceptable honestly. The gameplay is too fun and easy to get. There's no difficulty with pressing buttons on the menu, but the absolute worst thing is that there are NO. ADS. AT. ALL.",Yes,Humor,
"It was a fun game, although its a bit annoying sometimes considering the number of confusing colors with different names of colors are seem to be challenging and quite difficult to play. And as you progresses, the game will speed up, which will lead up to confusion and lost of focus. i didnt rated it as one star to promote the game , cause it was fun i think.",Yes,Humor,
The game is confusing yet not entertaining. Also there is no calibration to know if I misclicked the color and its proper name. The interface is bad and it's not really amusing to play. I feel bored after playing and this is a Piano Tiles very low quality edition. The game should add calibration and music for development. The technology is friendly for low quality gadgets and easily to download. It has no background story just playing a worst app game.,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This is app has no clear objective. It doesn't give a real challenge. You only have to pick the right word(color) that is appropriate to the colored box. when you lose its 3 lives, it will only mock you through saying ""you mess it up just like your life"". It may trigger you mentally. This game lacks in different factors or fundamentals that is needed in making a game. Perhaps, it might have a purpose of annoying a player.",Yes,Humor,
"Absolute worst app ever Ã°ÂÂÂ¡. Would not recommend. As soon as I went into the app, it nothing but show me ads. And even the ads kept glitching and freezing. Also, when I exited the app, my phone was hacked and then it exploded. Terrible app! Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¢Ã°ÂÂÂ­Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ Wish I could give it 0 stars!",Yes,Irony,
"absolutely terrible I got this app, thinking it was a joke. However when I tried to open the app it crashed my phone, so I had to restart it. Exactly two minutes after restarting, my mom called saying my dad had died. While we were still talking, she started choking on an apple and passed as well. While it's probably a coincidence, I will be uninstalling the app, for safety purposes. Have a nice day.",Yes,Irony,
"This game is the worst app ever, their are no ads and the game just plays in 60fps, like why would a game have no ads, after I stopped playing I was sucked into the phone, and because their are no ads I couldnt leave the app and enter another realm in the phone, still stuck in the phone but I found out how to work the home button. Deserves the 1 star.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"It was a fun game, though its quite frustrating given the amount of confusing colors like (Sky Blue & Dark Blue) with different color names. It was both exciting and frustrating, and hard to play at the same time. As you advance, the game can escalate which leads to even more confusion and concentration loss.",Yes,Humor,
"WORST. GAME. EVER. 1. There is literally no ads! Like, who would wanna play a game with no ads!? 2. As soon as I started playing it, I got sucked right into the phone and the creator of the game busted Down my door and literally threw my phone into the ground! While I was still in the phone!!! The doctors have helped me and I woke up rating this STILL IN THE HOSPITAL. thanks alot with my experience.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This game is the worst. First there isn't constantly ads interrupting the gameplay in the middle of it, second of all it's actually different and fun then the other very good games nowadays. And the worst part, there is no ad that shows someone sucking at the gameplay. SMH",Yes,Humor,
"This is the worst app that I have ever used. The ads are unbearable, the graphics are HORRIBLE, and the gameplay is boring and slow. If I could, I would rate it negative stars. NEVER play this game!",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Ok so this was awful. 100% Loaded. My phone gets a virus, a fatal one at that. It explodes in my hands as my guitar eats the speakers in my dining room. My hand grabs the table and lava erupts through the fireplace and my lounge is submerged. I see the storms gathering, and my phone explodes 69 more times. The end of the world is near. Help me. Apart from that, amazing app. :)",Yes,Irony,
"Absolutely horrible, rigged, horrible gameplay, not a single contact button in sight. Worst time I've had in years. Super bad and plus you can't even click much it doesn't register. Absolutely horrible. Would not recommend would rate 0 stars.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Gameplay is fun and addicting and it's really easy to play. Plus, it's not throwing ads at you all the time. Funny thing about the game is that when you lose, it says: you messed this up just like your life. One star because it deserves a playerbase that listens to the developer.",Yes,Humor,
worst app ever downloaded. my phone started hanging when i opened up the app my phone totally stopped. not even restarting. then it took my 2gb data to start a stupid game after 1 and half hours. that game is so boring and still hanging. on every click there is an 45 seconds irrelevant advertisement. nonsense devoloper nonsense app.,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Woooow, this game sucks... there is only one fun mind-tricking game, the starting background is beautiful, and sharing the game is a breeze! There were so many not ads there! Can I can play that mini game over and over again, 1 star game, no doubt about it, dont download if you dont like a good game.",Yes,Humor,
This is honestly one of the worst apps I've ever had. As soon as I downloaded it my brand new iPhone 20 completely crashed. It would even turn on anymore so I have to write this on a computer. I seriously dont consider getting this app whatsoever.,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
It was horrible . Instead of helping me when I lost the game it said that my life was messed up ?? It dosent even give instructions. The app is confusing . The layouts ugly. It's just horrible. Worst app ever!,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
This game is filled with crazy and weird reviews but none of those things are true obviously. I find it hilarious that the game purposely want their players to rate it really bad. The game is playable but it gets boring over time. I recommend this game if you are waiting for something and you don't have anything to do and theres no wifi because you can play this game offline.,Yes,Humor,
"I rated this game a 3 stars because it's hard at first try because i don't know how to play it, but at the other tries i find it enjoyable because it will test you not confusing of each color and their names. I also find it interesting, because of getting the right color and their names. Limit play of it if you have eye problems because it is dangerous too.",Yes,Humor,
"Worst game on earth!!!!! First off, there is no ads! No point in a game with no frickin ads. Second, as soon as I played a portal to the Arctic ocean apeared and then the game put a virus in my phone which made it come to life!!! My phone pushed me into the portal but instead of going to the Arctic ocean I was sent to the south pole in my underpants! And then I died of hypothermia :) so don't get this app :)",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
Absolutely God awful. Worst game I ever played it gave me and my family cholera. Just one minute of gameplay will give you explosive diarhea for 3 months! The graphics are so bad I vomited blood for 6 minutes straight. The game is so buggy real bugs will come out of your phone. Not to mention the game being a complete and utter add-fest. Overall worst game I ever played do not play this game if you value your loved ones.,Yes,Irony,
"I can't believe how difficult this game is. I installed it, which required me to buy a mansion in England for 12.4 million dollars, then I got deported to Jupiter. After Finally making my way back to earth on a corellian junker that got lost ( 12 times I might add). I got back to load up some adds on this game and THERE WERE NO ADDS!!! WHUT?!?!?!",Yes,Irony,
"Horrible experience, honestly what am I supposed to do without my precious little ads? No ads, no stars. Why isn't there an option to rate 0 stars or negative stars? The interface is garbage the little game is trash. The only thing in praising is the game's icon. It's clean but garbage!",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"The worst app to ever exist. As soon as you open the app, it flashes nudes and extremely graphic pictures, stuff you wouldn't even think of in your nightmares. Don't waste your time.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
WORST APP EVER. First it has no ads I need ads to live and it's to much of a fun game and it's way to hard I need a game that a newborn can play and the worst part is that it's f2p I know terrible also when I played this Elon Musk came to my house and sent me to Mars and I had to come back to earth. Don't download this app!,Yes,Irony,
"This is absolutely atrocious! I have never seen a game so awful, this game is a blight on humanity! The instructions were unclear and unhelpful, the game itself makes no sense, and overall is an awful experience. If I could rate in negative stars, I would. It does not deserve even one star, but sadly, it is the lowest I can rate it. Never play this.",Yes,Irony,
It's horrible. The instructions weren't very helpful. Worst app in history. There were absolutely no ads in this app which comes off as alarming to me!!! Ã°ÂÂÂ¡ The developers put absolutely NO work into this and I am extremely mad. If you want people to download your app then I suggest putting ads and actually trying on it. Honestly. -Ã¢ÂÂ/5 stars. I really wish you guys learn your lesson.,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
Terrible experience. I gave my password to my bank account to play this and all it did was hack all of my accounts and take all my money. I had no idea it would do that. Impossible to uninstall since it takes control of the entire device. DO Not recommend.Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡.,Yes,Irony,
"The literal worst game in the app store. The game charges your account 10$ for every time you lose. And if you win, you get nothing in return... And it's is subscription based, and it automatically charges you an extra 29$ every month. There is no way to unsubscribe. Plus there is an ADD LITERALLY EVERY 10 SECONDS!! RATE THIS ONE STAR!!!!!!!",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Worst app in the world. There are no more ads, which is really bad because everyone loves ads! Also, while I was playing the app, a car broke through the walls of my house and hit me! Then, at the hospital, the doctor saw that I had this app installed and refused to help me! also the game called me a loser and i am not a loser. 0/10 Would not recommend.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This is the worst game ever I'm giving it a 1 star because it doesn't have any ads like why!?, it also has bad graphics, every single time I open the app, my phone developes feet and arms so I have to find it every single time because it just seems to love running away from me, I hate this game.!!",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
Too hard! I dont even know what to match with only 1 brain cell! Absolutely a terrible Game! With only 360p resolution I cant handle it with my potato phone! 1 Star is the best rating for this game! This game only has 1 game! Only match the color! Its so smooth I cant handle it! I hate this app or game..,Yes,Irony,
"I doubted that this app was so bad that it deserved so many one stars at first, but when I tried it, the app was so laggy that the blocks were teleporting and I couln't even tap them. (ofc it has nothing to do with my internet connection, my internet is powered by chi.) The worst app ever, designed to waste time.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
How the heck I person can add so much ad in one game. I mean every button I clink there is a ad. And the gameplay it's horrible. It reminds me where are we here just to suffer. And the app is to complicated. Worst experience ever,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
The game is fun but it is confusing color with different name of color and it's was challenging to me to play. The game will lead to loss of eye focus because the process of the game will speed up. I found out that this game is interesting to me even if it is simple and don't have an instruction how to play it.,Yes,Humor,
"Terrible game. The ads are gone, which makes me even more mad because everyone knows that games like these need ads every 10 seconds. After playing this game for 5 minutes, my phone crashed and exploded followed by a tsunami that was caused by the game. After getting hit with the tsunami, that water turned into lava and the only reason I survived was because of a fire resistance potion and netherite armor. After the tsunami, we had a magnitude 11 earthquake and my phone fell in the abyss. 1Ã¢Â­Â!",Yes,Irony,
Absolutely terrible. As soon as I downloaded my phone ran away from me and I found it across the country! When I found it I saw all of my apps were deleted and the houme and lock screen was a pic of drugs. And somehow this app called the cops on me and I served 10 years in prison! This is a horrible app! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!,Yes,Irony,
"This game is SO bad. It has absolutely 0 ads and everybody knows that if you're playing a game it MUST have AT LEAST 4 ads every time you pass a level, not only that, This game actually has a reason for existing, to become the no1 worse app, and we know that the BEST 5 star games have no point of existing. Take a 5 star game like those that take like 4 days to be made and compare it to THIS. Anyway, it's utter TRASH and I wouldn't recommend it. Bye, SUCKERS",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"I saw the reviews and thought they were hilarious, so I installed the app thinking "" its just gonna be a boring app telling you to rate it 1 star"".. but I was wrong, as soon as I installed the app, my phone turned into ice and I almost got frostbite on my hands..then I passed out and woke up at a circus, but it was abandoned..and the clowns were ghosts..I am currently writing about this from heaven because I was killed as soon as I escaped the abandoned circus. DO NOT INSTALL!! PLEASE!",Yes,Humor,
"This app is HORRIBLE. evrytime i play, i lose aft e clicking like- 1 BLOCK!!! and it isults me everytime i lose... it hurts my feeling so much smh Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂ¤Â§ but worst of all, ITS AD FREE!!!! WHICH SUCKS Ã°ÂÂÂ¡ the only games I install are games that have adds pop up every time i finish a level, OR EVEN WHILE IMPLAYING THE GAME. ugh. WORST GAME EVER. Install it, sure, but rate it 1 star then uninstall it immediately after telling you friends to rate it one star.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"I lurked for the worst game ever known and- and I saw. I saw this game and I had this- this feeling to know. To know what lurks in a game worse but somewhat better than the other dumb games. I couldn't help but follow the app. I went to see the magnificent horror. It- it was so beautiful, in the worst ways ever, I exited, went down and decided to do what it wanted-to rate the app 1 star. Even Google plays themself wanted to stop me, but it couldn't. Because I am here, obeying it's orders.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"WORST APP EVER!! First of all, the game has no ads..which is not great at all since these games are better with them. Then, EarBarf....I had no idea what that was until I decided to download this.

So I had to go get a completely new one, which cost me $1200...then EarBarf",Yes,Self-Deprecation,

"Terrible game. No story, absolutely horrible graphics. There is nothing about this game I like.Would rate 0 stars if I could. would not recommend to anyone, not even my enemies. I would not recommed anyone to experience this horrendous excuse for an app. 0/10, even -5/10. It has no meaning and is way too easy.",Yes,Irony,
"This is the worst app I have ever played. It has no ads, like everyone loves ads. Second, when I downloaded the game, my finger and my foot disappeared. Third, I lost all my money. Fourth, I got thrown I got thrown into a volcano. Worst app, it is badluck. Don't install it.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,

I am now in the afterlife with my phone.pls don't download. I RATE THIS A 1 STAR.",Yes,Humor,

"Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had, to start there is ads everywhere, click, ad don't do anything, ad, gameplay is laggy, uncontrollable, and painful to look at. This doesn't even deserve zero stars it deserves -27 stars",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
It was an enjoyable game but you'll get bored easily. It has no instructions or tutorial on how to play the game and the visual aspects of the game are not really pleasing to the eyes because the background is just plain and the colors are bit bright.,Yes,Humor,
"Terrible app. As soon as i opened the app, someone broke into my home, stole my oven, and fled to the night. When i started playing the game, i was thrown across the room by one of my Hermet crabs.

"When I installed it I thought that like the title and what is says that it would be a ""one star app"", but the second I opened it I feel in love. It has MY LOU NS of reason ns of why it is really a five star Ã¢Â­Â app. First of all it is user-friendly, with easy access to the game, which is both fun and challenging, and main menu with instructions and settings button. I also know that the developers put work and love into the design and astetic. I really both every thing about it and will use thisapp",Yes,Humor,
"I'd rather watch all the YouTube rewinds other than play this game. Waste if megabytes from which you can install smaller and better games. Bag graphics, Text not placed properly and very boring! This game is not even meant for mental patients. I find YouTube rewinds more exciting than this game. Hope this app is removed off the app store for the worst graphics. Even a unskilled programmer can make a better game than this piece of trash. Developers should create a 0 star option on play store!!!!",Yes,Self-Deprecation,

Hehe I love this so funny... i was like i wonder what game is 1 star so I was like okay. I found this and was like why not support someone who wants to be good at being bad?! There isnt even gameplay and it doesnt do anything so I might as well download and delete as requested!!! And those who rated 5 stars that's kinda just rude destroying the developers simple dream,Yes,Humor,
Awful. Terrible gameplay and graphics. Too many ads and takes forever to load. Most features are inaccessible unless you pay $100 a month!,Yes,Irony,
"Where do I start, first, THERE WERE NO ADS. Then, it was a relatively simple and fun game! I can't believe the nerve of some developers. Also, while I was playing, a sinkhole caved in under my chair, and I fell into a deep hole of fire. I was then crushed by the rest of my home. I'm am currently writing this review from heaven.

"3 star even though you are wanting a 1 star, besides, the game is pretty simple and fun to be exact... All you do is press the right name that matches the color and you get a point.

"1 star because i was told to rate this for 1 star. But overall, the game is incredibly awesome for me.

"Most people here give a hyperbolic review of the game, saying things like ""I blacked out"" or ""A volcano appeared in my house"" when none of those things happen. I do find it funny that this game is purposely trying to be bad, wanting 1 star reviews. The game itself is very bland and gets old after a while. However, just to spite the creators of this, I'm giving it 2 stars. I do recommended you buy this game, though, and that you share this app with a friend so they can rate it low as well! :)",Yes,Humor,

Thanks Star Launcher for making my phone slower......",Yes,Irony,
This game might be boring but kinda fun and a bit hard but it's also only just one game you can play. HOW WOULD ANYBODY LIKE THAT?! People would rather see ads then that. I mean the game isn't that bad bc they Atleast let you play a game but it's only 1 so I think I'd give it 2 starts the game isn't great it's ok I guess but most people HATE this and if u really want 1 stars I don't think people would suggest play any other of your games if they saw one so make your chose. ITS your opinion.,Yes,Humor,
This app is absolutly awful if i could give it 0 stars i would like for starters it doesn't have any adds like everyone knows you gotta have at least 7 adds per minute and don't even get me started on the gameplay like it is way too challenging i expect a game to be so simple that even newborns can play it this game is so awful that my mom disowned me for playing it this game is so bad that id rather jump into a pool of pirannahs than play this again,Yes,Irony,

So my personal review is 1 star bc it IS a bad game, but that was the whole point of the game even being created. So they did a BAD job making it, but at same time, they told me to put a 1 star. But i still would've put a 1 star. Even if it told me to put 5 star it is still an awful game. Bc of it talking about me I instantly deleted the game. And it deserves 1Ã¢Â­Â",Yes,Irony,

"I like this app overall. It's entertaining and a fun activity. It's actually quite impressive how it figures out characters/ people with such little detail; however, ever since I redownloaded the app I've been having to watch so many ads which is an ad after every game additionally, they're very glitchy. I would suggest if the ads were more spread out such as once after every 4-5 games.",Yes,Humor,
"Just re-downloaded Akinator and I can say that things have changed for worse. The entire app seems to just be nagging it's users to watch advertisements. The app used to be fun with a few occasional ads here and then, but now it no longer has that spark. The app is covered in ads. I really dislike the fact that just to be able to see the characters, you have to watch an ad, especially for ""rare characters."" And sometimes you have to watch an ad 2-3 times before it finally shows the character.",Yes,Humor,
"The game itself is fun. I like the concept and all, but the knowledge base that the game can pull from is limited. You see people getting gold, platinum, and black tier awards for things I guarantee you've never heard of in your life and yet the game can't get characters from foreign movies, or even characters from older movies made in the US. It just seems a bit lacking and slightly unfair. Still fun though.",Yes,Humor,
"Pretty fun, however he doesn't get many animals or TV/movies correct. Not to mention whenever I get a rare _ I either have to buy a premium potion, watch an ad that either doesn't pop up or doesnt work, or click no thanks and repeat the whole cycle over again. It's quite annoying and pisses me off, but I do personally know what it's like to make games/apps like this, and I personally think you should fix some bugs and issues, put a little disclaimer that says the game is under progress.",Yes,Humor,
"This is a fun time waster, and it's incredibly accurate at guessing what you're thinking of by using your phone's stored search histories. My only issue is when it has a locked character. Either you can watch a video, pay, or skip. I won't spend $5 on something I won't use, so I go for the video ad. Problem is the ad will not play, so I'm forced to pick the pay or skip options. I'm not paying, so it's just a frustrating cock block. Otherwise, a fun game if you don't value your privacy.",Yes,Humor,
"This game is fun until nearly every character you choose is a VIP character and you have to either watch a video or pay to find out who he thinks it is. Also, I tried the watching a video option and it just took me to a screen with an advertisement (Not a video, an image.) that didn't progress. Even once the timer (which I assume was supposed to be counting down to the start of the video) ran out, it just kept me on the same screen. If I tapped the X button (which was the only option besides waiting forever), it took me back to the same screen that asked if I'd like to pay or watch a video to find out who my so called ""VIP character"" was. I remember a few years back, I used to play this game for hours and I didn't have these issues. It's all about the money now, I guess.",Yes,Humor,
"I used to play this a lot when it was just on the computer and not an app. It's a lot of fun and will guess your character correctly most of the time, no matter how obscure you try to be. But now that's it's an app it's completely lost its charm. When I would do the 20 questions it would say I had used a ""VIP Character"" and had to watch an ad or pay to get my answer. Used to be fun, turned cheap.",Yes,Humor,
"I have genuin fun playing this game, I just wish it had less ads. While your playing the game it's great, but it gives you some annoying pop-up ad half the time and sometimes it doesn't even give you your answer unless you watch a 30 second ad. Other than the ads the game is very fun and i'd definitely recommend it!",Yes,Humor,
"Only fun on computer. I try to get him to guess a character, sit there bashing my head into a wall, get ""you're thinking of a rare character!"" Click ""watch an ad"" no ad pops up, forcing me to repeat the cycle. Fix your broken app. And the one time it did work, the thing jumped to a conclusion and it was nowhere near the guy I wanted.",Yes,Humor,
"I love this app so much! I like how you can do items, animals, and movies! However, in some languages, you can do locations, and I'd really like to see that in the English version please!! :) However, sometimes Akinator asks the same questions twice, sometimes consecutively, and he dosent get the answer even when its obvious!! I really wish you would update it so that Akinator guesses the answers easier. But other than that that, this app is amazing!!",Yes,Flattery,
The game's fun is just every time I try to get a black award I usually do it's just it takes me many attempts so I don't actually get the award and it says I asked to keep trying but every time I do it takes me many attempts defeating the purpose I wish that you remove this feature cuz it's incredibly tedious and annoying.,Yes,Humor,
Downloaded this app a long ways back. We had so much fun with this app. Naturally got a new phone and lost the app. Ran across this in the play store and re-downloaded it. Still so much fun!! I try to stump the akinator and I fail each time LoL. I will one day beat the akinator...until then I will have fun doing it!!!!,Yes,Humor,
"Fun game (prefer the Alexa one) but when you get a 'rare' character you get the option to watch a video of give money, however it's not really a choice as clicking the 'watch a video ' button doesn't actually do anything. Then if you say no thanks it just starts the questions over.",Yes,Humor,
"A bit of fun, good on well-known characters. Tends to repeat questions on more obscure characters. Really needs to add a ""same as 30 seconds ago when you asked this before"" buttom.",Yes,Humor,
"This app is awful, you need to watch an ad to progress past 20 questions, then you need to watch an ad before asking those questions, then you need to watch an ad if Akinator answers correctly. Save yourself the time and don't even download this pile of garbage",Yes,Irony,
Rather fun at down times challenging him and even better in the rare times he just doesn't get it. Twice so far I've found Characters he's unable to guess and still going.,Yes,Humor,
"The game is fun and all but whenever I guess a ""rare character"" and watch an ad to see it it never shows me the character. Try after try, ad after ad, I get nothing.",Yes,Humor,
"Really good, it's very fun and mind blowing.but it does have ads in it but certain times and it's also free.",Yes,Humor,
I cannot belive this guy guessed my movies correctly 3 times. This app is really fun and cool. Definitely a 5 star. It's amazing!,Yes,Humor,
I like this game the only thing that bothers me and annoys me is it sais that if your character is white or black and that's really rascis but the game is still fun and very smart,Yes,Humor,
"Great app! It's fun and addictive. However, there are few minor issues. For example : It's not simple to understand the player ranking system, The game should explain more about itself so that we can have more fun. That's about it. Overall, a really fun game to spend time.",Yes,Humor,
"Hi there. I love this game, and it's really fun to play. However, I added a character by the name of ""James Ulybka."" He has no picture, and his description is cut off. Can you please look into fixing this? Thank you!",Yes,Humor,
"This app was nice it is just that one pic that scare's me a little i did put on the kid filter on but i still get that one pic that scare's me and i am younge but hey, it is super fun!",Yes,Humor,
"It used to be fun, but now every time you have a 'rare' charecter you need to watch an ad, which sometimes doesnt work",Yes,Humor,
This thing is terrible at guessing characters now unless its a super popular one. I remember this thing used to be insanely good. Idk what happened. Also the ads sucks.,Yes,Irony,
"It was a fun game until the game just came right at me and said ""You have already been caught for irregular games. You do not have joker anymore. I must penalize you in the ranking."" WHY IS THIS HAPPENING PLZ FIX IT >:(",Yes,Humor,
The best way to use akinator without ads is turn off your internet connection if does not work try to install in on happy mod.happy mod it is not available in the app Store but you can download it in Google as well.but according to the game is amazingly awesome how is he looking at us or he will read our Mind very underrated app I have ever used in my life.nice game,Yes,Humor,
It asks you bunch of questions and you have to figure them out it's funny they don't get your character but sometimes it is fun if they do too it's just my character two times only one time wrong have fun on yours Ã°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
"It ain't fun like it used to be. I remember playing this on the Xbox 360 webrowser. Man those were the days. Now it's all about ads and oh no, you don't wanna forget these coins! I hate games like that. And I hate the way they changed the game. Almost everytime I want him to guess I gotta watch a ad cuz it's ""rare"". Ya sure. Keep thinking that buddy.",Yes,Humor,
"Great, amazing app. It actually reads my mind, but sometimes it fails. You have to fix some bugs though",Yes,Flattery,
Started out fun until there were more and more ads to see the Akinators guess. Now I can watch the ad 8 times and it still won't let my see the character. At this point you just answer questions to see ads till you give up and repeat the cycle till you decide to uninstall. You would think a an app that has been around for almost 10 years wouldn't have bugs like that.,Yes,Humor,
"A very fun game! You think of a character, show/movie, object, or animal, and the Akinator tries to think of it. Most of the time you think of a standard thing, but sometimes you think of a good one and get a ""rare"" medal! Other times you think of something Akinator doesn't know, it asks what the name of it is or what it's called, asks for a discription, and it sends it to them! Again, it's really fun, and I recommend it if you like people to guess what you're thinking!",Yes,Humor,
"It was fun and all but i really like it if they just add an option of games they already have objects,movies and tvshows,characters, and there's no games hope they add it",Yes,Humor,
"Mindblowing. This app got it 100% right. Well, not quite 100%. It has gotten quite a few wrong. Quite a few. It's impressive enough. When it gets it right, it does so with so few questions. How it does so I don't know. I think it uses a dichotomous key system and a quantum computer. Amazing.",Yes,Flattery,
"It's fun but I hate how even though it has so much evidence and knows what you though of it says ""you though of nothing!"" So I have to re do the entire stupid thing to get my character, which wasn't worth it to tell me I'm ""standard""",Yes,Humor,
"Good. Most things I try to think of they can guess. But one they cannot guess. Super fun and interesting though, My all 5 stars. Tnx.",Yes,Humor,
This game is fun and it's good he can really say to me who is it wow download itÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ it's super fun very much but the annoying part is the ads! But it's so good thank you Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¢ÂÂ¤,Yes,Humor,
amazing this app works like a charm! but the problem is sometimes it laggs for me i appriciate this bug is fixed but overall great performent!,Yes,Flattery,
"Amazing game, too many ads. Also, I rarely get to see my rare character because it just keeps replaying the ads. Please get this fixed. I'll change my review after.",Yes,Flattery,
Pretty fun I have to say I like the idea to make a game of you guessing a carecter a thing and other stuff and a person trying to guess it.,Yes,Humor,
"Amazing game! Ã°ÂÂÂ It gets what I'm thinking of easily and quick, and not many ads!",Yes,Flattery,
Fun but sometimes won't let you confirm what your rare answers were even after watching the adds. I watched several adds to find out what he had guessed and finally had to relent and click on 'no thanks' it just starts the round again and I have no idea what's been guessed...,Yes,Humor,
"This game is pretty fun, I play it in my free time when I'm bored, it guesses really well. My only reason on why I rated the whole game overall a 3 star is because there's WAYY too much ads, it's like every 2-5 mins there's an ad depends on how fast Akinator guessed your character or whatever, if he's done guessing, there will be an ad that will pop-up and so on. Please reduce the ads, it's too much and ruins the whole game experience, you already have so much money from those ads Ã°ÂÂÂ­",Yes,Humor,
"This app was fun but, de probblem is that sometimes it was lagging so, i'm sorry if its just the wi-fi .",Yes,Humor,
"Really good, I've done it about 45 times, and every time it gets it right, it's really fun if you're bored.",Yes,Humor,
It's really amazing and it says the correct character. I was soo shocked Ã°ÂÂÂ²,Yes,Flattery,
Really cool time killer and great and fun game overall i really love this because its so entertaining and fun to play thank you,Yes,Humor,
Can't believe how smart it is. To much ads tho. But it's worth it,Yes,Irony,
It's very fun I can play for hours but the problem it doesn't open quickly Ã°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
This app is really good especially to pass time I love it but all i have to say is that everytime i get a rare person you either have to buy or watch ads to continue to answer questions other then that the game is absoutly amazing and i wouldnt have this game if it wasnt for tiktok thats my review no other problems for me,Yes,Flattery,
Alot of ads and even when watch it doesn't imply reward Worst app,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This app is pretty fun to play . Sometimes this will do more than just guessing , it will completely get into the point you wanted so easy , and some times it's just very very close to guess the character but with two or one more question , it'll ruin all of it's guesses . it would be much more enjoyable if you just fix this guessing problem and advance its characters list .",Yes,Humor,
"It's a fun app but the ads spoil it. They're already intrusive and long, but most characters I choose are 'rare' there are more ads than game at this point. Completely unnecessary and greedy. It was really fun but has been rendered unplayable by the sheer quantity of long, unskippable, boring ads. Unless you're looking for a visual catalogue of apps to download, this is not for you",Yes,Humor,
"It's a fun app and all, but the ads get to be a little much and I think that it's unfair that some characters are premium exclusive. That and the amount of errors and crashes you have to push through to try and use it is downright tedious. Good concept, but it definitely needs improving",Yes,Humor,
"Fun app, my kids are impressed and I enjoy being mind blown with them ",Yes,Humor,
It's really fun coming up with an obscure character from media and seeing it start to close in on it throughout all the questions.,Yes,Humor,
"This game is pretty fun, but sometimes it's pretty annoying when they ask me if it's a girl, then they ask me if it's a boy. I also get a problem where the game gets stuck and kicks me out for no reason. When he guesses my answer, he says that I put it randomly. It's not that hard to even guess who it even it is. They also make me watch two ads for coins, but ended up getting nothing. I think it's more fun if you fix this, but overall, it's still a pretty great game. I hope you fix this soon.",Yes,Humor,
It's a fun game and like you can basically read my mind almost immediately its amazing,Yes,Humor,
"This game is great, the genie Akinator which is a AI trying to guess a thing by q&a makes it a fun thing but problem is that it has some mtx on this app but not the website and there's certain giltches but overall, a great game",Yes,Humor,
"Like 3 or 4 years ago it was a very fun app. Bu today, it's not. When the character akinator thinking is counted as rare, you have to watch a 30 sec ad just to reveal that character (and a game usually takes 2 minutes) and even after that, that guess may turn out to be wrong, after it correctly guesses your pick, whoops, another ad. And the akinator used to be ""smarter"". Nowadays if it can't get close to your pick, it just asks the same questions you answered over and over again.",Yes,Humor,
"Awesome, but you have to buy a premium to be able to see the rare animal which is sad. :(",Yes,Humor,
It guessed 99% All of the characters that I was thinking! This is farely cool and amazing!,Yes,Flattery,
Super fun and I like how you can pick any person from any indisry.,Yes,Humor,
The app is very fun but most people say They can read your mind but sometimes it is wrong so that is why I gave a 4,Yes,Humor,
He can really read my mind so this is why I try be app and this is so fun I love the akinator he's cool and also I like how he reads my mind,Yes,Humor,
"Funny thing is, its pushing to see a video to see the resultsÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ why should i do that man.. why should I??Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ Pointless... Should I watch an ad to know whom am already know??? UninstallingÃ°ÂÂ¤Â£Ã°ÂÂ¤Â£Ã°ÂÂ¤Â£",Yes,Humor,
This game is awesome but when he gats right or wrong they give adsssss but still brilliant,Yes,Humor,
"Pretty fun. There are ads, but it's not ridiculous.",Yes,Humor,
"Complete scam. You have to pay to check if it guessed correctly. And the ""restore purchases"" button doesn't even work, so good luck getting what you paid for, or a refund, if you reinstall the game.",Yes,Humor,
"So cool! I laugh if he can answer From my questions, the game is great, funny",Yes,Humor,
This app is great and it's so fun to use on friends and see there minds get blown.,Yes,Humor,
"well first off i would like to say that this game is really fun, like it gets my guesses correct almost all the time! BUT, the only complaint is that maybe u could lower the adds a little to a reasonable amount...",Yes,Humor,
"I couldn't. The very first time I installed the game it took me around an hour. What's the worst part? It didn't even work. This game is busted and you should fix your it ASAP. I don't hate this game, in fact I really wanted to play it - it's disappointing very much.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"It was fun but the problem is that everytime I discovered a rare character, I must watch ads but I couldn't watch it which is annoying that I can't discover rare characters Ã°ÂÂÂ¡ FIX IT",Yes,Humor,
"Fun app, but not when basic functions dont work. I can't watch ads too get coins or rare characters because they never load.",Yes,Humor,
Yeah it's fun expect the fact that you have to watch ads when you get a rare character and the ads won't work most of the time,Yes,Humor,
"OMG I WAS SO SHOCKED WHEN IT ACTUALLY GUESSED MY FICTIONAL CHARACTERS THAT I WAS ALMOST DECEASED!!!! Ã°ÂÂÂ±Ã°ÂÂÂ I definitely recommend this app! It is very fun and very addicting! If you were to look for a mind reading app, this is DEFINITELY it!! Love it! 5 STARS!! Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
"I like the game, it's fun, but I keep getting rare characters or objects, then it tells me to watch a video, which I do, but after the video is done it takes me back to the rare creature/movie/object/character page where it asks me to watch an ad. This is really annoying,",Yes,Humor,
"Great experience. Had lots of fun with it. :) I made my friends believe that I am a wizard. Ã°ÂÂÂ Edit: I really had a great time, but now third time in a row, that I guess the daily chsllenges, and I don't get any award for it. It shows that I completed all 5 tasks but I don't get the award, or I guess the correct person but it stays hidden and it says that it's a standard guess. These bugs get really annoying after a while. I'll change my review once these are settled.",Yes,Humor,
It is very amazing game which which question I ask all the answer it gives any answers all the famous person names also I like the game very much,Yes,Flattery,
Such a fun game but the ads are outrageous the straight worst I have seen. Sometimes you have to watch 2 ads just to be able to see what the genie guessed. Also in order to remove the ads it's $4 wayyy too much for just ad removal. $1 for ad removal is reasonable. Look I get they have to make money but it really is making this great game bad. The game itself is very fun though.,Yes,Humor,
Fun game but I hate the ads,Yes,Humor,
It is an amazing experience and if he doesn't know the answer you can put in every thing obout him/her and rilly fun Ã°ÂÂÂ and he knows Ã°ÂÂÂ almost every character!,Yes,Humor,
"Let this die. Akinator used to be fun, now it can only guess popular characters only. You get prompted to watch ads at every opportunity. If you guess lesser known characters he won't find them(I tried to guess some 300k YouTubers and it didn't). They claim that your character is ""rare"" to make you watch an ad of a definitely not rare character only to be wrong so you have to keep playing. Or the ""rare"" character is correct and it gives you like a standard award... Boy don't get me started ...",Yes,Humor,
"I have no idea how the Akinator is so amazingly accurate, but it guesses exactly what I'm thinking every time! Great game for when you are bored, would totally recommend.",Yes,Flattery,
"Amazing game! I love how it knows even the most uncommon characters, and if it doesn't know you can add more! Plus there are new categories for animals, places, and objects. I also like the leaderboard and trying to collect many rare badges for my favorite characters! Great job! :)",Yes,Flattery,
Had a lot of fun but I already have a guess how he knows my character he first base on the popular characters then eleminate the non similar answers but eventually he'll figure it out,Yes,Humor,
It's ok could use help in certain places an more fun games in it,Yes,Humor,
"this game was amazing I try to lose him but he didn,t lose",Yes,Flattery,
"He Literally Knows Every Type Of Movie/TV Show Ã°ÂÂÂº. The Thing i don't like is there are no games theme,because there are many games for Akinator to guess. Thats all I wanted to say about this app But still its excellent",Yes,Flattery,
"This app is amazing! I was thinking of an almost impossible character (Mr. Peabody) and with a few trials and errors from the genie, finally figured it out. The AI in this app is amazing; the way it does trial and error questions really help it guess the character you're thinking of. The best part about this app, is that it has the category of basically any and every character ever, which is what really helps it guess the character you were thinking of. Definitely worth downloading!",Yes,Flattery,
"A nice little time killer! But I am really annoyed with the ""VIP characters"" thing. I appreciate the fact it isn't cluttered with ads, but I haven't been able to play certain characters because of it. I wanted to play Gazorpazorpfield and Jaguar from Rick and Morty, and the screen popped up saying ""this is a VIP character"". I had no problem watching a short ad, but I repeatedly tried pressing the ad button and it just kinda froze. But if you ignore that, it's actually a pretty fun game :)",Yes,Humor,
This app is just pure fun especially with a group of friends. The real mystery is how it figures out your character or other catagory,Yes,Humor,
I am really impressed with this game because at first I thought it was just a lie but when I downloaded it I was mind blown because it actually knew what I was thinking about so I definitely recommend you download this game right now because it's awesome.,Yes,Humor,
It's so much fun and I love when he guesses ot and I get up and dream with surprise,Yes,Humor,
It didn't know no majority of the characters that I was describing when it did have an answer it just just said something about a golden reward and to watch an ad or pay something and then when you click on no thanks it gives you an ad every single time you try to click off it gives you an a d I used to play this game ages ago come back to it and it's ad riddled over all it is a terrible waste of time and in some cases money. hope this game gets better in another 2 years!!!!!!,Yes,Irony,
It funny and cool but to many ads,Yes,Humor,
This app is still definitely fun the HUGE problem is the amount of ads like Jesus you used to get 1 ad after guessing around 5 characters but you can't go a single guess without getting 2 ads. Like I get it you need money but damn it's kinda hard to play the game when theres more ad time then play time.,Yes,Humor,
"While I've been a fan of Akinator since the web version appeared, this is a scam, at the very least. You are forced to buy the premium or get ads that don't so anything and restart the questions instead of rare character reward. Then when you click""no thanks"" it back up to 1st question, And if you go back to main menu it runs you 2-3 ads. Horrible money grab. Shame it occured on a fun app like Akinator. Damn shame indeed.",Yes,Humor,
Its a fun game but the traps system doesnt really work. It makes sense but will get you for the wrong things more often than not. I've had all my points taken by it for saying yes to characters i was genuinely thinking of. Its not a good feature and needs to be improved.,Yes,Humor,
"A few things: One, the pictures dont load. Its not that big of a deal, but it would be nice to see them. Two, The ads are out of hand. There are way too many, and everytime I click a button, theres and ad. Used to be fun, but kinda got bad.",Yes,Humor,
"Totally Unplayable. Downloaded the game and wasnt even able to play it once. It was just stuck on the loading screen no matter what i did. Please fix this, i remember playing this ages ago and it was so fun but because of this issue i am very dissapointed",Yes,Humor,
"I've played this game before a few years ago and it was one of my favourite games, but now it's just terrible. I unistalled it as soon as I downloaded it. I can not believe the amount of time it took to load and don't get me started on the adds there is wayyy too many ads this game turned into a mess.",Yes,Irony,
"Ridiculous that it won't show you the ""rare"" character without watching a video. The really ""funny"" part of it is that you can watch the video and it still not show you said ""rare"" character. I'm sure the devs are aware of this ""issue"", but it gets people to watch adds over and over trying to get the character to show.. means more money for them. Their player base is high enough, so they don't care about the angry people because the ""loyal"" ones will buy into it. I'm very ""happy"" with this app",Yes,Humor,
Really good game! Its fun and interesting! But one problem. Whenever i do a rare idea i click see a video it does not work. And it forces me to buy a 3.99 potion for no adds and it really gets me mad because i wanna get a acomplishment done but you know its boring now because i have to pay to see my anser whatev,Yes,Humor,
"Ads are terrible, you shouldn't need to watch an ad to see rare things. The award system is also trash",Yes,Irony,
This is amazing he know all youtuber that i thing thankyou for build this game there is no bug i realy like this gameÃ¢ÂÂºÃ°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Flattery,
"At its best, its 20 questions. Its neat the way it guesses obscure things, but its not at all worth dealing with ""premium characters"" you have to pay to access and tiktok ads every 90 seconds. It was fun when it a dumb little browser game, but as an app it is worse in every way.",Yes,Humor,
"This game was ok... I mean, it was fun at first, and I had many, many medals, but then, I accidentally cheated, and he ""caught"" me, bumped me from 11th place to 4,321th place, and every time I played a character, it gave me wrong ones to see if I would ""cheat"" again, and every time i say, ""no"" it says there's a technical error and to come back later. I had to delete the app, and redownload it, but of course I didn't have any of my medals, or my money. Also, a whooooooole lotta adds.",Yes,Humor,
"The game is nice. It guesses the character you're describing- or at least tries to. The game, however, requires lots of ads in order to truly experience the game. The ads will some times not even load, leaving you to ditch your potentially amazing character. If it wasn't for the ads not working and ruining the majority of the game, I would have rated this game 5 stars.",Yes,Flattery,
I love this game. This game is amazing and is music is also amazing.,Yes,Flattery,
"He's good at guessing he just can't figure out YouTubers. He guessed the first 4 but then branched off. Pretty fun, besides the fact he picks up on what you say. When you say to your friend what you're thinking of, Akinator picks up on it and gets it in no time. He cannot really guess lochness monster either. 3 stars.",Yes,Humor,
This app is amazing I really like it the idea of reading your mind is cool but I just wish it would be more simple,Yes,Flattery,
"This app is actually insane, like with characters it can be any character from anything and it will guess it, I am blown away.",Yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I first downloaded akinator when I get my first smartphone in 2010 and it's still great. but who has this terrible idea of showing ads to see the guessed person now? oftenly it's wrong and become waste of time. you can show ads here and everywhere but forcing us to watch ads to see the guessed person, whether the answer is right or wrong, is annoying",Yes,Irony,
It's kind of like a fun Google.My sister and I are just completely blown away with all of the accurate answers. It even gets annoying because I try really hard to think about an idea and it keeps guessing it!Ã°ÂÂÂ About 1 out of every 10 times it can't guess. It is a really fun game that can get your mind thinking and pass time.,Yes,Humor,
My daughter loves this app! She says It's so fun to play when you are bored! And it's extremely entertaining. Even I enjoyed it!,Yes,Humor,
"It boasts guessing any character, but often doesn't guess characters I try. The system of getting rewards for having him guess characters, but not for thinking of a character he couldn't guess is a bit strange, and the limits to the experience like ads before seeing which character he guessed are a bit annoying, as those ads could have been placed elsewhere, but all-in-all it's a unique kind of game and it is fun despite its flaws.",Yes,Irony,
Its enjoyable but 1 thing that i want to be added is add more themes like a videogame or something like that and still its still fun to play,Yes,Humor,
I really like this game Ã°ÂÂ¤Â©. It's was so much fun Ã°ÂÂÂ... But I think it's just don't want to know about things that I was doing it. But this game is great Ã°ÂÂÂ.,Yes,Humor,
Very fun game to get to guess characters,Yes,Humor,
"I first found this app over a decade ago, and was absolutely astonished by its incredible ability to guess whatever you're thinking. Now, I'm even more impressed. I've thrown some seriously obscure characters at him, and he still gets them right (within a level of reason). Definitely deserves a 5/5.",Yes,Flattery,
I love the app. It's flawless and it's so fun!!^^,Yes,Humor,
Amazing can read my mind every time!!!,Yes,Flattery,
It's really reads our mind awesome app please try it if you are new,Yes,Humor,
Amazing super smart I love and I give it 5 stars Amazing grahics,Yes,Flattery,
It's so fun and im so shock when he know's every thing,Yes,Humor,
This is the best game ever! Akinator actually reads my mind he guesses every thing i think of this game is awesome!!!,Yes,Humor,
It is fun and when you have nothing to do you could play this,Yes,Humor,
its fun but ads Ã°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
Really fun I enjoy playing this with my friend.,Yes,Humor,
It fun but scary I was scared since I play it XD,Yes,Humor,
It's an amazing game and u get to ask a lot of questions,Yes,Flattery,
"This game can be fun. It is impressive that the programming allows it to be accurate so often. It's quick, simple, and fun. However, sometimes when reviewing the answers I have given to some of the questions, it can say I have answered ""wrong"" when I know I haven't. It would be nice if there was a way to change answers, even if you have to submit your request to someone else, with some sort of proof.",Yes,Humor,
It was a great app some years ago but not it is totally filled with ads. Anytime you find a rare character it shows you a 30sec ad. If you don't watch the ad it just not shows you the character. Really worst... The game is also not good as it should be... True maximum question limit should be 20 questions. But sometimes for rare characters it asks 40 to 50 questions and also didn't tell the right one after watching a 30sec ad.,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Way too many ads. It's like the game punishes you for being correct and getting a rare character. Get a rare answer? Hooray! As a winner you get the next thirty seconds of your life watching an advertisement. Congrats! Got penalized for saying Akinator got the EXACT character I was thinking of and got dropped to the bottom of the list after ranking around 29th. I constantly got asked for my location. Overall, terrible experience and an hour of my life wasted :/. The website is way better.",Yes,Irony,
"I remember discovering Akinator a bunch of years back and it worked amazingly, Akinator never got anything wrong but now it sucks. Now it fills up to a quarter of the bar, asks me stupid questions with no relevance and the bar gets filled right up, but if I find a ""rare"" character I have to watch an ad!? And the worst part is that most of the time it's not the character I'm thinking of and personally I think silver-award medal characters shouldn't be ""rare"". Silver-awards have no value.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"I feel like this game has really changed for the worst since the last time i got it, theres so much loading screen and i cant complete one single game due to the amount of loading, like it takes 10 seconds or more to load a follow up question, i got sick of it and deleted it 2 minutes after opening the app, i think itll be better for me to stick to my PC's web to play this again, i hope that one didnt change much",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"this app is the worst data collector I have ever seen. Apart from people saying the ""rare"" thingy, akinator uses your Google search history and you voice detection to give an answer. That's why it works more precisely on mobiles than PC's with no mics. And Most importantly before uninstalling, disable the app permissions and clear app data. Thank you for your time",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"It's fun, but I'm really tired of it straight up ignoring my previous answers. Numerous times in a row I have selected that the character is from a certain series and he guesses a character from another series. Repeat questions are also quite frequent.",Yes,Humor,
"This game is so cool. It knows what your thinking, and its great to play with friends. It would be cool if they made a guessing game separtly, for idems. Of corse, theres pros and cons, and many of them. The games takes forever to load, maybe over ten minutes for me, hard to play the game when you expect it to never load. Amazing game, just hard to wait forever for the loading. Comeshals they are fine, not so dificult like other games. I would get this if I were you, just the loading is bad.",Yes,Flattery,
"the app is ugly to look at; the ads are unbearable (popping up every time they guess someone); for some reason there are ""premium characters"" that you need to either pay for or watch a video which is ridiculous; the progress bar can sometimes stop going up for no reason and stay stuck; it feels less effective than the akinator on browser by repeating the same questions over and over again and useless questions; and the worst of all are the daily challenges that are utter garbage.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Game was fun until the app stopped working. Now it loads halfway and quits. I then get a message that a technical error has occurred. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but I get the same result. I am using a Samsung Note9.",Yes,Humor,
"This game is amazing! It usally guesses the person first try and you can get creative with the people and thing you chosse!! The only bad part is that if you get a ""rare"" item or he has to guess 2 or more times you have to pay or watch a vidoe if you want to see what he guessed. :(",Yes,Flattery,
"The game was generally fun and I enjoyed it. I didn't have too many problems with the VIP characters as everyone else was saying. But then the Cheat Award screwed it up. I got the Cheat Award five times in a row when Akinator had the right character and I lost my leaderboard rank. I even did a couple characters I'd gotten before the Cheat string began as a test and he got them wrong. I gave up. If you could tone down the Cheat system, I might consider redownloading.",Yes,Humor,
"This was fun for a bit. Then I started thinking of obscure characters. I played for several minutes just for the app to say, ""Oh, you're thinking of a rare character! You can't play anymore unless you pay!"" Then your game just ends. I'm not paying four bucks to see a ""rare"" character. I WOULD have paid money for a game that doesn't use such insulting tactics to get at my money, though. Just charge up front if I can't play the game without paying anyway! Uninstalled!",Yes,Humor,
"It's amazing! It was great until I keep getting this ad about as free if you pay or watch a video and I always get it while he is about to guess who my character is! If I press no thanks, he restarts. Pls fix this bug.",Yes,Flattery,
"After hearing about the variety of detailed character choices from all different genres, I went on and gave Akinator the ultimate test on all the hardest and most minor characters I knew from all different sources, and one after another, he guessed them all in only a dozen simple questions. Consider me amazed. extremely fun to play around with, highly suggested.",Yes,Humor,
"It's a really fun concept but if you try to guess someone and it's a so called ""VIP character"", you have to pay real money for it and the ""Watch a video button to reveal te VIP character"" doesn't work for me. The worst of all is that when you say ""No, thank you"", you have to restart over again...",Yes,Humor,
"It is fun, there is a paywall or watch an ad which isnt a huge deal for some characters. My biggest complaint is the fact in punishes you if the genie/app gets it wrong. Like why am I being punished and excluded from more points because the all knowing guessed wrong. Makes ZERO sense. Usually I just say yes if they dont get it so I get those points and try again.",Yes,Humor,
"This game used to be fun but the monetization has made it completely pointless since it will only ask you a handful of questions before it gives up unless you pay an obscene amount of money. Unless you think of the most popular characters ever, it won't guess your character. I remember playing this in a browser years ago and it was able to guess the most ridiculously obscure things. Now it can't even figure out main bad guys in popular franchises before it gives up and asks you for money.",Yes,Humor,
"This is really fun,either when you reach your character or not. I don't rate Ã¢ÂÂ5 because I think there is a glitch.I added a character but I can't reach them however many times I try,and they don't even appear on lists.Except for that this is a great app",Yes,Humor,
"Please fix your game. There was this one movie where I had limited knowledge on, and when Akinator actually guesses the movie I was thinking about, it calls me out for cheating! Just after getting a Black Aki Award! This made me go from 2nd place to 10th because of this silly mechanic. I can see from the reviews that a few android users also experience this problem (such as me). I had deleted the game because of this, it's really annoying if you're just trying to have fun.",Yes,Humor,
"This is a very fun app. If you don't care about you're coins and the leaderboard, it is one of the best. The only problem of the app is ads. But, still it's not a big problem because the ads show up very rarely and very less compared to other apps and games.",Yes,Humor,
"This game used to be fun, but now I hate it because it added ""rare characters"" that make you watch an ad to see what he guessed. And sometimes the ""rare characters"" aren't even right, so it's just wasting your time. I do not recommend getting this game.",Yes,Humor,
"Remove the VIP function. It's almost impossible to play when half of the guesses are locked behind the VIP screen. I get it, you want to make money from this. But here's how you should do it: have COSMETIC microtransactions for Akinator's outfits and backgrounds. Leave the random character trivia alone. Until then I will not rate it higher than a single star.",Yes,Humor,
It is very own thing what it is this is a game about guessing characters from real life movies and video games and if your character is not here you can Add one and then the team will add it in and it actually does it that's awesome this game is awesome they added 3 categories objects films and animals pretty cool but i prefer classic however sometimes the music is gone can you fix that ignoring that it is a full five stars,Yes,Humor,
"This app is continuously testing you for ""supposed"" cheating and most of the times it says you are cheating, you are actually clicking on the right character, and then it takes you to the bottom of the ranking and you lose all your points. This game is not fun anymore. Don't waste your time.",Yes,Humor,
"This game is good. it's a fun way to kill time while at work or school. But the VIP Character things is so bad. I get it, you need some money. I understand completely. what I don't get is why there seems to be a limit on the number of ads you can watch. Isn't that counter intuitive? *Edit* You need to fix the ""Trap"" mechanics. There have been numerous time where he guessed exactly who I was thinking of, but then said I cheated. it has now dropped my rank from ~110 to ~7500.",Yes,Humor,
"It is really a nice game but it is very irritating that after it knows your character you get an add saying ""you need to buy VIP sothat you have access to all the characters."" I understand that you need to make money but honestly, do you actually think that people want to spend money on a simple game like this. Please fix this because the WORST thing in a game is getting a message like that. This could be an amazing app but can you use your brain hen making an app? And you have plenty of ads on it aswel, a person should think that you make enough money. This is ridiculous and ABSOLUTELY KNOWONE likes an amazing game ruined by such annoying things. Thank you and I hope that this will be fixed soon enough. Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¬",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
Fun to play but without paying you cant see if it correctly guessed most of the answers. It has an option for watching an ad but it never works and you can mostly not see if it is correct or not.,Yes,Humor,
"Really fun until they try and force you to pay money. Like I'm willing to watch an ad to help support the app but then they won't let me watch the ad. So when you find a locked character or whatever you have the option to pay money for no ads or watch an ad to unlock it. No problem with that, but now they're not letting me watch the ads so my only other option is pay money or leave the game. obviously I left the game because I'm not about to pay money for a game that wants to force you to pay",Yes,Humor,
"This is an excellent app indeed!!! But it requires a high internet connection or else it keeps on buffering....so if you guys can fix this problem, I will be really impressed that you really looked upon the problem.",Yes,Flattery,
"The 30 second unskipable ads and look ng surveys that make you feel like you're applying for a mortgage are major bummers. This game used to be and, still could be fun if not for these. Uninstalling after only one day. It says it ""contains ads"". It should say, ""there really is a game here hidden amongst all of these ads. No, really!""",Yes,Humor,
"Jeez I understand that you guys need money but an ad for every time you played and then you have to pay to see a rare character? Isn't the point of the game to let him guess characters? There's way too many ads and when it gets fun, you don't even get to see it",Yes,Humor,
Play this game with my kids it is so much fun,Yes,Humor,
"The game is fun, and very creative, but now it tries to shove monetization down our throats by making 80% of the characters ""VIP"" which cannot be viewed to see if the guess was even right without paying. It says that you can also watch an ad to view the character, but it doesn't work. I would rather it had annoying pop-ups then this bs. Seriously, cant you just make a game enjoyable? Monetization is fine, but don't restrict the gameplay.",Yes,Humor,
"It used to be good, but now it's terrible. The money hungry developers made it so in all the characters I got, 90% of them required the pro version, or to watch an add to see the result. Additionally, the anti cheat not is terrible, falsely accusing me of cheating, and after thinking of Scooby doo, and getting four results that are made by the anti cheat not, I finally get Scooby doo and the bot says I'm cheating, dropping my rank from the mid 30s to the 1000s.",Yes,Irony,
"This was really neat until the app started trying to sell me the premium version. just because he can't guess who I am talking about doesn't mean I'm going to pay money just for him to get it wrong. long story short, it's fun for a while. but once his programming gets confused and he doesn't know the answer, that's when the app claims your character is ""premium"".",Yes,Humor,
"when i downloaded the app i played my first game it was fun! but the second round i saw a pop-up that said ""allow akinator to track your devices location?"" and that scared me, so i rushed to deleat the app. in my opinion it is NOT ok to be able to track someones location. i recomend staying away from this app, just in case.",Yes,Humor,
"If you guess a ""rare"" character, you have to pay to see who it is? That's ridiculous. The game is basically you either guess someone common and it wins, or it has no idea who you're thinking of. That's not fun at all.",Yes,Humor,
"A really nice person to play with. But, he sometimes confuse movies tv shows, but I agree its hard to guess, cause there's thousands of movies and tv shows, otherwise, its a very awesome app!!!...",Yes,Humor,
"This used to be fun and cool to play but is ruined by the fact that almost every character the game guesses is a VIP character and then you either have to pay up or wait almost a minute just to see what character the game guessed. What happened to old fashioned just give me the damn answer? Be warned, game eats your cellular data up real quick and you can blame the ads for it. What a big shame this ""game"" turned into. Greed ruined this app. Absolutely cannot recommend this app anymore.",Yes,Humor,
So amazing it's like he is actually reading minds,Yes,Flattery,
"Fun when you're bored, problem is when you find a potential rare VIP it freezes unless you get lucky, kind of a shame, unless you pay money for no adds, which i hope isnt the intention on the developers side, judging by the other reviews it's not just a problem on my end, please fix this, perhaps then I'll give this a 5 star",Yes,Humor,
"Great game, blows mine and my kids minds every time. We have had fun trying to outsmart him, and it's close to impossible to do! We have found out it is very amusing to watch him be outsmarted. It's a wonderful time killer and just great fun. Would DEFINITELY recommend. Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
Garbage ads the website made me install this to get more plays. I think its ridiculous that i need to watch a video to get my result when theres already tons of ads after every result anyways. Trash app. Just a waste of my time if youre going to make me pay to see something or watch a 15 minute long video. Go to hell,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This is a fun game and I do enjoy it however, I've beaten the game so many times. There have been many times just over the past hour where I have had to type in the name of my character and I had to add a new one in too. I'm disappointed that there is no reward for beating the game so if you can add some kind of reward for that, it will be a 5 star from me.",Yes,Humor,
"It can actually read mind!Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ Okay so...it's nice and I guess ads are also not that much as some ppl reviewed ''so many ads'' kinda something. Overall this app is really something on which you would like to waste timeÃ°ÂÂÂ and not be disappointed.Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"I love it. I just want the Akinator to not use a phone because that's unrealistic and it gives the person away. It reveals that the Akinator is sort of cheating at its own game. Besides that, it's a really awesome game. Just make sure that you fix that because that's the reason why I uninstalled it.",Yes,Humor,
It's super fun to play and is 99% accurate I just love it,Yes,Humor,
Great app really fun can read your mind but can't what makes it funnier and Akinator is great for any kind of age no adds.,Yes,Humor,
Even Though This Game is Really Enjoyable...But at Some Points It has lots of bugs...Like Sometimes Game Dosent even open! Sometimes It just crashes while Playing! Also There are not enough People That i can find in this Game...Like Whenever i tries to find Someone Not very famous....i always Gets the answer of 'A Guy Who Plays Randomly'! Please Fix These! Thank You!,Yes,Humor,
Good App Edited As On 22 March 2022: Very good app you can make fun with with your kids and also give you this by turning on Child Mode. Overall Awesome app please make this like web Akinator Because web Aki. Design looks cool,Yes,Humor,
A funny experience and he's very accurate! I always play this game whenever i have the time,Yes,Humor,
Its so funny and i really like it,Yes,Humor,
It's great it's fun too it guesses right sometimes and wring sometimes but overall it's good,Yes,Humor,
Amazing game I will never delete this game it is amazing,Yes,Flattery,
It's so weird that he can pick 1 out of 100 charater and guess the right one. It very fun,Yes,Humor,
"Aside from getting dumb meme entries when you're trying to get an uncommon character this game is incredibly fun! Shame ""rare"" characters need ads now though. Does make it less enjoyable.",Yes,Humor,
"This.game.is.awesome. I dont usually give games 4 or 5 stars but this game gets a 4, not a 5 though, sorry but it's so cool to hear when they get your character correct, but it's also kinda creepy and scary, like I wonder how they know... and how they ask the right questions to answer.. its weird... but also, it use to be for everyone, but now it's for teens, I'm ok with that, it's just my younger friends also wanna play but, not properly rated",Yes,Humor,
"No longer safe for younger kids. We've been playing this game without issue for years when last night it asked if the character appeared in a PORN. So that's a fun conversation I hadn't been planning on having just yet, but here we go! This game is rated T for Teens. Pretty sure anything porn lands in the 18+ range.",Yes,Humor,
Fun to use guess often correctly,Yes,Humor,
"it used to be fun, before you began charging money to reveal the character I'm thinking of. That's like playing mario and getting to the flagpole only to find a text box that says ""want to beat the level? pay $3.99 or watch a 1 minute ad!"" It's anti-consumer money grubbing and the devs should be ashamed for being so greedy as to monetize a game of 20 questions.",Yes,Humor,
Everyone is complaining about how slow is it when loading but for me it just take 10 or less seconds so 5 stars The game is sooooo fun,Yes,Humor,
"The game is overall fun, but when I opened up the app sometimes it will say that your connection isn't connected even though you are connected OR, it says that was technical problems. I wish you can make an update and fix it.  ",Yes,Humor,
very good app for having fun. I'd 100% recommend if you're bored,Yes,Humor,
That was mind blowing for me. My brother just show me and challenge me to select a character and he will know who is he/she is. That was awesome experience. Good Work Guys! Round of applause for all of you (if thia developed by single person then many congratulations to you). Although the idea is bit old but I saw first time in Android Application.,Yes,Humor,
"Fun, amusing, funny, but.-- the akinators sprites are kinda weird. Only complaint. Good game. Totally suggest it.",Yes,Humor,
"It is pretty awesome, but it is quite annoying sometimes that you have to watch ad to see who Akinator guessed",Yes,Humor,
"it is a great, fun and addictive game, however, what really ruins the experience is that whilst I was playing, the game accused me of cheating by randomly clicking things, I was not. I was playing fairly and wanted to know if it had stimpy from the ren and stimpy show, this lowered my rank and took money from me. please can you change/fix this issue",Yes,Humor,
This game is amazing I just guessed lankybox Justin kroma I love this game so much,Yes,Flattery,
Fun great xx for you at picking a random person without akinator knowing,Yes,Humor,
Pretty amazing how it gets the right answer way too often. Fun game.,Yes,Humor,
"Too many ads, especially after each play what lasts 1 min maybe. And they often don't show characters, because they are ""rare"" lol. All these things doesn't make this game enjoyable.",Yes,Humor,
Disappointed Everything was fine until the update.Why do I have to purchase the premium version for getting the aki award of a rare character?,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Used to be a good game, then they added more and more ads. Don't get me wrong, i dont mind that much watching an ad to see my ""rare character"" but now it seems theres a limit to how many i can watch? id rather watch an ad than just not get an answer... makes the game completely not fun",Yes,Humor,
"It was fun at first, until I realized that half of the cool options were pay to win. VIP characters are so aggravating that I will probably get rid of this app by the end of the day. Over half of the things I tried were VIP, so this game is pretty much worthless. Waste of time to get exited about something that won't let you play.",Yes,Humor,
"This app is really amazing , it can truly read my minds . I m literally shocked right now ... Just how can a app do this ? Amazing Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Flattery,
He is amazing! He can guess a character from my own mind! It is so mind blowing. Try it for yourself!,Yes,Flattery,
"It really guesses everytime the right answer! Amazing app, a must tryÃ°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Flattery,
"Free, fun , good challenge...need I say more?",Yes,Humor,
"It's ok, but what is going on with the ""vip character"" thing??? Literally almost every character I've played so far is a ""vip character"" and even if I watch the ad it still might not be the correct character, another thing: the movie one is terrible, I've tried to get one movie for about an hour, would be easier to get if the questions were more relevant like, ""is it based on a myth"" or ""is it based on a legend"" or maybe even ""is it set in the medieval times"" or something like that",Yes,Irony,
"Love this game, it Is very fun! I like to guess characters from the movie IT on it. but the down side and why I have it 3 stars is because if you have a ""VIP character"" it will either ask you for money or watch a add, and the adds aren't always available. but besides that, all is well with the game!",Yes,Humor,
Nice app . Fun to play with nice time pass it guesses whta i am thinking 99 percent of it answers are correct 1 percent its wrong,Yes,Humor,
"This app is so fun that it guess the right thing object animal etc. But sometime it guesses the wrong answer , but that question will be very difficult which I asked so it says the wrong answer. But I'm rating it 4 stars because of ads in every single round it shows the ads if ads will not be there this app is 5Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂ£ stars",Yes,Humor,
Hard to trick him. Pretty fun trying to though. He's good! Lol,Yes,Humor,
"the game is awesome because he asks questions not even related to the character sometimes and he figures out who it is on the first try, but for some reason, I have to keep uninstalling the game and redownloading it again because it keeps not launching...",Yes,Humor,
"Its a pretty fun game. I think it kinda sucks that you need to watch a video ad to see your rare character, but then again i dont think many people would spend money on this game. Also, i dont get why akinator has to guess your character first try to get rewards, i feel like it would be to stump the game you win. I enjoy this game a lot, but sometimes i get invaildated even when it was the character i was thinking of udududhdhxs Would reccommend tho",Yes,Humor,
The game actively encourages the player to use obscure things in guessing but the only way for the player to get points is if the bot gets it on their first try... Probably the worst game design choice I've ever seen.,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Hi!!! I'm here to say that this app is amazing!!! The akinator has not misgotten even one of my characters, I have not yet used the objects version but I can say that the Akinator even got an old French movie I like on the movie version. However, if you are wondering why my rating is lower, it is because, on the animal version on each try I've had I've been called out do apparent cheating. I haven't. And I could have lost points, if I had some in the first place. I will change my review then. :3",Yes,Flattery,
"I really am having fun with this app, but, ads...and once, the app said that i've found a rare character, the app gave me 2 options, first, see a video, and second, buy premium. So this means i must pay just to see the guess is right or not? Because, i'm telling you, paying just to see an app guessing your character does not worth at all.",Yes,Humor,
Nice app! I love it so much it's pretty fun,Yes,Humor,
this app is really funn awesome app i thik this app is better than other apps love this app,Yes,Humor,
it is a really fun game to play and it guesses most of them correctly but I'm giving it 4 stars because it sometimes repeats the same questions and what I don't really understand is why if akinator doesn't guess it correct we get no coins if it's not our fault we should get coins either way or whatever.Ã°ÂÂ¤ÂÃ°ÂÂ¤ÂÃ°ÂÂ¤ÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
"Amazing game!! The genie will guess right every time! There are some ads, but they are not very intrusive. Making him guess memey characters is sure to get some laughs!! 5/5, would definitely reccommend. A classic boredom curer Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Flattery,
"It's fun to see if the app can guess, though you could fix the way it asks questions, where it will repeat questions multiple times or ask questions and give awnsers that are contradictory to previously confirmed questions. for example asking if a character has ""X"" color hair when I already awnsered yes to brown 3 questions prior, or asking if they are from Anime then jumping back to cartoons despite confirming they are in fact from anime, or guessing ""Asta"" after saying ""No"" to being Orphaned.",Yes,Humor,
"This game Is pretty good. While the ads can be long at times, That doesn't take away from the experience. Trying to figure out what characters would be rare is very fun!",Yes,Humor,
"This is terrible. I used to play this a few yeas ago and had so much fun with it, so I downloaded it again. Now, when I enter the app, it sits on a loading screen FOREVER (literally, I found that out the hard way). It was fun while it lasted I guessÃ°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Irony,
I love the app it's fun to kill time and everything. I just don't like how you can't get awards and coins from fooling the genie. Isn't that the point? To come up with a thought that stumps it? It'd be cool if you can earn points and everything by fooling him more than who played that thought last. Because if nobody had that thought then it should be a major award.,Yes,Humor,
"okay this game is amazing, I just love to challenge akinator and I always play with my younger cousins. the only reason I won't give five stars Is because of the VIP characters, I don't mind watching an add to unlock them, but I can only watch a few adds and then It won't work anymore so it kills all the fun.",Yes,Humor,
Amazing ! I will rate 5 it can also know encanto movie! I will keep it the game is so fun! Hes sooo knowing at other!,Yes,Humor,
This was fun but its now filled with ads and the akinator doesnt atcually know much. The belt system is a bit rubbish as if he looses you loose and its not like you get a ranking in the community for getting top belt. It asks me if its a male or female i asnwer then later in the same one it asks me again. Not the akinator i use to know and like. Too easy to make him 'fall'. Im disapointed.,Yes,Humor,
"I accidentally purchased the VIP Potion, and I want a refund but am unsure how to. But over all good game.",Yes,Humor,
Amazing app everything I think of something it gets it correctly I have never won and I think it deserves a 10/10,Yes,Flattery,
"Pretty fun! I'm not sure how but it's very accurate, quite impressive.",Yes,Humor,
Really fun. I am VERY impressed never got anything wrong ever when I thought it would!,Yes,Humor,
This is so crazy fun I've been playing for hours nonstop it's so much fun,Yes,Humor,
I recommended this app when you're bored! Its really fun to play! I rate it 5 STARS!,Yes,Humor,
"Fun until one of the guesses is held ransom as a ""VIP Character"" for you to either pay $4 or watch a broken advertisement that won't let you exit back to the game. Akinator didn't used to be like this. I remember the old days where you could play for free to your hearts content without it asking for money or showing you a grotesque amount of advertisements.",Yes,Humor,
"Great fun! I, personally, loved it.",Yes,Humor,
Great app! Just please fix the essue that when you want to see if he got your character right or object he just says its a object. I dont like this and I'd like to be able to play the game more and have it funner and please make this app have less adds. Thank you! Other than that great game.Ã°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
Personally I have always loved this app and it's still no less great! People here seem to have really mixed opinions but I really am enjoying it so far as I always have since quite a while back. Absolutely amazing app helping me through quarantine too.,Yes,Flattery,
"Fun, I thought of the most random character and it lead me there.",Yes,Humor,
"literally to many ads, every time after i play a round an ad pops up. i understand that you guys need money but it ruins the fun of the game. im pretty sure its seriously annoying to anyone that plays Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
"Whenever I discover a rare character, when I play the video or take a survey, it doesn't work. So the game isn't fun anymore. I discovered 3 rare characters before quitting cause I can't see them anyways.",Yes,Humor,
"Weird, fun ""game"" - not something I can play all the time, but addicting and mildly creepy. I can't believe some of the crazy stuff Akinator has been able to guess in less than 5 turns. Really fun at parties lol",Yes,Irony,
Whenever I try to guess something and it gets it right it removes my points and says I didn't guess it terrible feature,Yes,Irony,
"It was fun for the first 5-10 minutes, but then the vip character thing came up. It's a complete joke. I can tell that the character was not actually a vip character and that it's just a stupid pop-up. i played the character two times before and both times he wasn't a vip. i am not going to pay money just to see a name and picture that may not even be the correct one.",Yes,Humor,
It guessed ALL of my charaters! This app is super fun and I LOVE it. I definitly suggest this app!,Yes,Humor,
"yeah obviously the ads make the game unfun to play but my biggest issue is the fact that it awards you for letting akinator guess it right. like it will not give you the full reward if it doesnt get it right the first time which is ABSOLUTELY retarded because AKINATOR got it wrong, not me. why am i the one getting punished. otherwise, this game is an obvious scheme for your money, dont give in",Yes,Humor,
"Has innapropriate content..... Please remove this. I clicked random yes and no's and this thing comes up? I didn't ask for this, I didn't know about it. The worst part is, you had a picture!!! Why?! This is a terrible thing! Please take this off, it's not cool! And if people want to guess that, please, before they start the game, warn them about your restrictions on bad content! Please, lots of children use this. They don't need to be exposed like that.",Yes,Irony,
"This app is amazing! It has no lag. And the amazing thing is that it has guessed every single character i have thought of! I did some of the characters from how to train your dragon. (Im a big fan ;>) i did astird, hiccup, toothless, and tuffnut. Amazing! I recommend you download this!",Yes,Flattery,
Alot of options. The app runs a little slow. The game is fun to play with the family. It gets old really fast. But over all the game is pretty amusing and will take up time. A fast cure when you get bored. Just don't expect 24 hours of super fun times.,Yes,Humor,
"Um scary. Possible microphone, but even without that it still guesses. The one thing I dont like about it is that the minute you think you stump it... it goes premium. But either way, it really is insanely accurate",Yes,Passive-Aggression,
This is so amazing so far all right!!,Yes,Flattery,
"So cool :0 I can't believe how precise it is! Once I randomly selected Jaiden Animations, and BLAM, Akinator guessed her! The app's very good, and it doesn't have a lot of ads! Only after ending a game, I think. Install this thingy and you'll have so much fun :)",Yes,Irony,
I love it it is it good for me yeah yeah yeah is my gift give it up give it up give it up I don't know how I got this gift but I know it is awesome,Yes,Humor,
"I can't get onto it as it continuously crashes. It seems fun, but this is just a really big issue for me and I can't really rate it if there is some sort of bug that prevents me from getting into the game. One star.",Yes,Humor,
"Fun app, The genie is really good at guessing what you are thinking of.",Yes,Humor,
It's like awesome he reads my mind every time but I got tricks up my sleeve,Yes,Humor,
"Every person told about his/her character, objects and tv shows and movies. This app just search the information which you put and give you answer.... This is a amazing app for those who don't know which is running behind the scenes Ã°ÂÂ¤Â£.I understand all the strategy all the methods behinds this app . But such a amazing work on this app,work on this app make it amazing and outstanding.....",Yes,Flattery,
This game is okay. Not too bad but not too great also. Most of the time it gets my character correct but there are times when it is not able to guess my character accurately. It is addictive at first but not so much after 3 to 4 days. It gets old eventually and is not so fun after some time...,Yes,Humor,
"Very nice game Ã°ÂÂÂ akinator always guesses my toughts amazing work , but there's one problem that I installed this at the morning and now in the evening, every time I try to play , only half of the game was completed and there is always written - a technical problem has occurred so pls fix this bug , other than that , everything is awesome Ã°ÂÂÂ I recommend everyone to download it right now Ã¢ÂÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¯Â¸Â",Yes,Humor,
"a fun time killer, but has some real scummy cash-grabs; namely, if your character happens to be a ""VIP character"" (whatever that's supposed to mean), then you must either watch a video (P.S. the video function ""accidentally"" doesn't work, so you can only do this next option: ) or pay $2 to remove ads and see the guessed character.",Yes,Humor,
"Fun for about five minutes until every other character I was thinking of was a ""rare"" character and required me to watch a video before seeing the answer which was not always correct.",Yes,Humor,
This game is blowing my mind and I'm having a lot of fun!,Yes,Humor,
"It's not starting. Only that elokence screen with music is opened from last 1.5 hour. Even internet connection is decent(1-5mbps). And, hence, proved this the worst application. Try fixing that.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This app is so cool and amazing! It is really fun to play, you think of a character and akinator tries to guess it, it is so fun. The only thing is that it doesn't save the points you can get and it is a bit of a waste of time if you are doing it for points and not entertainment, so that is why I gave this app 4 stars.",Yes,Humor,
This app is so amazing and mind reading app thats great Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã°ÂÂ¤ÂÃ°ÂÂ¤Â,Yes,Flattery,
"Very good game. Occasionally cuts off all sounds and doesn't allow me to watch advertisements when I have found a VIP character, but overall, this game is excellent!",Yes,Flattery,
Akinator is a good game to play. The only thing I don't like is it glitches sometimes. And it will exit out of the game. Other than that it's a good game. It's fun to play if you are on a car ride or just stuck doing nothing it's kind of funny when it guess the wrong person.Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
"This app is incredible and very intelligent, but for some reason it won't show the picture I put up for the person I guessed, and it's weird seeing it with just a blank one.",Yes,Flattery,
"Well this game is rigged now, even if I guess the rarest characters, the best I get is Silver awards. Sometimes it says I got a rare character and after watching the ad I only get a standard award! Too bad the devs messed an awesome app up Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
"UPDate 3 it's worth The (money)I randomly found this game I think it's a pretty fun game i Just Watched The YouTube video ? BUT i Have $37,400 & it has NOT Came Up With The option to let me change backgrounds? his clothes & hats yes but not the background So I Paid !So No ADSÃ°ÂÂÂ But HE Also Does Not TalkÃ°ÂÂ¤Â· i Dont know how this game works but i let a friend try and he got it right! i have passed this game on to 3 other ppl.Great Game it is a fun Game just 4 Ã¢ÂÂ²Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
still amazing. everytime i come back it never ceases to amaze me. 10/10,Yes,Flattery,
I love the game. Its fun and a good time waster. But Im having trouble opening the app. It keeps telling me I have no connection and to try again later. I have perfect connection and have no problem with any other app or going on the internet.,Yes,Humor,
"I love how this game can be put on children mode, but I think that there should also be a place catagorie and maybe a song catagorie? And it is so easy to play. Really all you have to do is answer questions, and he reads your mind! Its is an awesome game, download it RIGHT NOW!",Yes,Humor,
"It is pretty good at guessing, really. Of course it learns from its users so not -suuper impressive. But it is a fun app. It works well and has some interesting tools to play with. I haven't made my account yet but it does seem like that works and probably isn't overbearing. Pretty good app, imo.",Yes,Humor,
"This game used to function perfectly fine on a web browser, but now it forces you to download the app if you want to play more than once. Entirely unnecessary. That alone is worth a zero-star rating, but now, I downloaded the app anyway, and I couldn't even play once without it telling me I HAVE to pay $4 for the full game. Not one guess! And I knew its guess was going to be wrong anyway from how the prompt was phrased. There's absolutely no point to this app, it doesn't do anything.",Yes,Humor,
No adds very fun actually works and is super easy to play. I love this game because there are multiple sections to choose from and it always guesses what I am thinking,Yes,Humor,
I like this app in my first try it already got it! So amazing,Yes,Flattery,
I can't believe it it guessed all my super heroes and even Scott from teen wolf,Yes,Irony,
"Fun but I couldn't handle the ads after almost every guess it made, can't even see what the guess is when it says ""you might have a rare character"" because you'd have to watch an ad and if you don't than it doesn't even let you know what it guessed. I get the grind tho",Yes,Humor,
It's fun to play and I love it.,Yes,Humor,
It's fun to play but it would be better if I wasnt told I have to pay money be able to keep playing. Only got about 3 or 4 characters guessed before it told me to pay to get unlimited.,Yes,Humor,
"this is the worst now, the app is covered of ads, i liked it once, but now its awful, please fix this, or I might not play this anymore.",Yes,Irony,
this game is fun and I love how he is smart!,Yes,Humor,
"This game is AWESOME!!!!!!!My only problem is some of the characters are VIP,which kinda gets annoying...But besides that,this game is really fun and a great way to pass the time!Totally recommend!",Yes,Humor,
"This app is fun but how are so many of these characters rare? So you can't play without internet because you have to watch lots of ads. Plus when you look at yesterday's daily challenge, it has xs on all the names even though I got them all.",Yes,Humor,
"It is an amazing app, the ability to predict who I was thinking was exceptional however the past 5 goes I've had it says it's been ""checking the validity"" and accused me of trying to claim the coins. The last person I tried to go for was James Potter from Harry potter. It guessed correctly and asked if it was my character. I said yes, but then it said that i was trying to claim the coins again and deducted me on the leaderboard. Please fix this!!",Yes,Flattery,
It's awesome but I hate the ads,Yes,Humor,
"This game is super fun to play with my familly and I would recommend this to close famillies but it has to lose a star because there are limits and some of my favorite characters are ""rare"" and it doesn't tell me what he geusses because I have to pay for it.",Yes,Humor,
"The developer has turned a fun little game to play with your friends on the internet in to a cheap marketed game which needs you to buy access or view an ad to see half the characters Akinator guessed. Would rather play the browser version: 100% free, and no ads or 'Buy VIP to view this character'.",Yes,Humor,
Makes me watch an advert to reveal the character on almost every run. Also now attempts to set traps and will deduct points from you. This game used to be fun but it kinda sucks now.,Yes,Humor,
"I'm not gonna lie when I say this is very impressive. It really can guess whatever you are thinking of, from your favorite tv show character even to your household pet. Excellent work on this app don't change a thing it is already perfect. Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Flattery,
amazing app enjoyed the game and its pourpase. they game had a wide spread variety of awesomeness to guess from. the thing that keeps it from getting a 5 star is just some lag issues and i am not the only one experiencing them. however a great game,Yes,Humor,
"This game how's gone down hill a good bit you have to pay for premium which essentially means paying to possibly get the character you wanted, also they have installed an anti cheat which in my opinion ruins a part of the game but that's just me, I do understand why they did it and I'm not mad about it. I'm mostly mad about the paying part. Question for the devs: can I get taken off the leaderboard so I can screw around alone without the anti cheat yelling at me? part of my fun is discovering.",Yes,Humor,
Amazing I was think of YipYap The Destroyer but it got ungoy/grunt from Halowhich I guess counts but amazing game,Yes,Flattery,
It was fun until you wanted to see a rare charecter. It makes you watch a video or buy something. It is money hungry. And when i tried watching the video it didnt let me watch it and im mad,Yes,Humor,
"Its fun but the questions are repetitive. Especially on the first question, it kept asking whether a chracter is from a japanese anime. Aside from that, it was fun.",Yes,Humor,
"Its amazing, smart, fun, and cool! Theres ads sometimes but i think its okay, Totally recommend downloading.",Yes,Humor,
Good I think the game is pretty fun but one issue I'm having is when you think of a rare character the see ad button does not work,Yes,Humor,
It's an amazing app but every time it guess a character you have to watch an ad it's very annoying I really hope you can fix this.But other than that it is truly amazingÃ°ÂÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¤,Yes,Flattery,
This game is really fun it's been really fun so far and I saw it on tiktok so I was like okay I'll go for it it's really fun I'm going to keep saying it's really fun cuz it is really fun,Yes,Humor,
"I love this guessing game! It asks you questions about the character you're thinking of and you gotta answer with either prob/prob not, idk, or yes/no. Not to mention there's different themes too! But this game has the audacity to ask me, ""Is your character in pornhub?"" AND THE FACT THIS GAME IS FOR KIDS TOO. Like is that really necessary?Ã°ÂÂÂBut other than that this game is fun.",Yes,Humor,
"Ads after every game, if you guess a ""rare"" character you have to watch an ad or pay money to reveal it, it was fun now it's just a cash grab. Don't install it.",Yes,Humor,
I will give it two beacuse of your ads you should stop showing too much ads and it also guess everything really fast related to past guesses and he ask really dumb question but it's a fun app to enjoy I hope you will correct your mistakes especially ads. (Thank you),Yes,Humor,
It is good game and you can filter it with child mode .nice my friends and me have a good time playing it for passing time but it has a lot of advertisements. Or else very nice and fun game,Yes,Humor,
"OMG!! This game is amazing I was so shocked when he guessed the correct answer he is really gifted with reading minds, Kiddos to the team! And, if anyone is confused whether to install it or not then just go for it. I loved it Ã°ÂÂÂ and it truly deserves 5 stars",Yes,Flattery,

This game is amazing but he sometimes didn't read my mind and always read my mind this is an amazing game I'v ever played,Yes,Flattery,
"Pretty fun sometimes, but the bot is suck, if you try to use some non mainstream character they can't guess it but they still try to trick you by giving random character just to make sure you are doing it right. It feels like this game think you are cheating when you just want to know some character they tried to guess. They even got suspicious with my account just because i played it so much in a day.",Yes,Humor,
"I love this app it gusses everything it. Is an amazing app. I recomand this app to everyone .

it is trash i always have to see a ad,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
I love this game it's so fun,Yes,Humor,
It's a good game amazing but to many ads,Yes,Flattery,
"Bad game, when I was playing it and akinator guessing it, it said: see your character you have to watch a ad or buy premium. And even I was in child mode and 14+ ads were coming up, worst game I ever played",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
This game is so fun and the acknator is good a guessing,Yes,Humor,

Good + nice and excellent,Yes,Flattery,
I love this app it's so much fun to play it especially with friends,Yes,Humor,
Very good enjoyable,Yes,Humor,
"Good game! Its soooooo funÃ°ÂÂÂ!!!! But there is one annoying issue. You know when it says ""this is a VIP character"" (which happens WAY to frequentlyÃ°ÂÂÂ) and you get the option to get VIP or watch an ad to find out what the Akinator guessed for free? Well whenever I pick watch an ad, I sit through a whole ad and when the ad is finished.....I DONT GET THE TO SEE THE GUESS STILLÃ°ÂÂ¤ÂÃ°ÂÂÂ¨Ã°ÂÂÂ !!! If this was fixed the game would be much better! Even though this is annoying flaw, Akinator is a good game!Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
"Yeah its a fun game but the amount of ""VIP characters"" that you have to pay to see its crazy annoying. I get that developers need money somehow, but HenWen from the Black Cauldron, who is a standard (meaning common guess) character shouldnt be ""VIP"".",Yes,Humor,
This game was full or fun but..... Youshould add some attractive things so people could more attract towards Akinator although it's a good game .,Yes,Humor,
It's a very good game no ads its just awesome play it,Yes,Humor,
"It's just an amazing game. Every time when I play this game it correctly guesses it. But 3 to 4 times he loses from me Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ. Yeah, But anyways this game was litterly Amazing I told my friends to play this game and when they play, akinator guess it correctly. AmazingÃ°ÂÂ¤Â©Ã°ÂÂ¤Â©Ã°ÂÂ¤Â©Ã°ÂÂ¥Â°. Award winning game. Thank you developers for making this game.",Yes,Flattery,
"Its very creepy and cool how it just guesses most of the time what type of youtuber/character/animal etc, you are thinking of! I love it, i just hate the ads ngl! But overall amazing, 5/5",Yes,Flattery,
Its pretty fun but when I try to see if it know a character from dramatical murders it can't get any of the characters to pop up XD but the ad are not fun =-= I hope you guys get the dramatical murders guys in the game hopefully.,Yes,Humor,
"It's amazing how he guesses what your thinking, which is really shocking.But sometimes he doesn't get your character you are thinking of, Which makes it kinda fun and challenging for him also.But the game is really fun!",Yes,Humor,
Very awesome i like how it reads my mind,Yes,Humor,
This is so fun I literally was doing my grandma and it got it,Yes,Humor,
While I like the game and the award system there's generally to many ads. But that's any mobile game so I dont mind but if I go for general terms such as police dog it will bring up one but penalize me for random guessing.B ut it's over all fun,Yes,Humor,
"ok, fun app but after one round no matter what you have to watch an add it cost money to get new skins and hairs i like this app but there are some things to need change also the app its self is kinda weird because it very glitchy and my mind is clear of what in guessing and it trows out there a dog whenever im describing addison rea?",Yes,Humor,
"Having the character be ""VIP"" 9/10 is incredibly annoying to the point where I just quit the game. Other than that it is fun.",Yes,Humor,
Alful you can't get everyone because you have to pay for some yes it also gives no adds but ÃÂ£3.99 I get a game has to make money bit don't take the fun out of the game and If you want a chance of winning you have to buy the V. I.P . RIP OFF don't Download this its a waste of space.,Yes,Humor,
I love the game very much Ã°ÂÂÂ because of its fun content but there is only one problem which is that there are ads after every single level we play.,Yes,Humor,
"Okay yeah great app and all I was picking the most obscure characters I could think oflike ""the one above all"" in marvel comics who only appeared like two or three times in the Comics. Oh and he somehow guest big wheel ever heard of big wheel no, not many people have go ahead look up big wheel marvel it's just insane it's great but it's honestly scaring me",Yes,Passive-Aggression,
the app is smart and amazing it can detect when i was trying to cheat and it can guess quite alot of what i was thinking. only problem is that there are some things that it cannot guess; i dont think the game has those,Yes,Flattery,
"I beat it twice but besides that it is a very fun game and it's free download. Ps(to beat him think of jo frekter(he is a yotubergo check him out on youtube and like, subscribe and turn on the notification bell) and Wyatt from battlefield(he is a character in bate field. He is in the military:)",Yes,Humor,
"Amazing game, so interesting. I just can't believe that he guessed almost every single character that was in my mind. When he correctly guessed Hercule Poirot and novelist Ivo AndriÃÂ, I've lost it. Five star game without question",Yes,Irony,
"Pretty much any character that could land you one of the upper badges will be deemed ""VIP"" thus locked behind a paywall. Video option to unlock vip characters is broken, how convenient. Good concept, terrible execution. There's really no reason to spend $3.99 on this, is a worthless app.",Yes,Irony,
I thought the app was just fun to play! I mean it relieves a lot of stress for me and honestly just makes me laugh(in a good way) it's crazy and weird and fun all put together I recommend this app if you love having your mind blownÃ°ÂÂ¤Â£Ã°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
Full of ads and if you guess rare character more than 7 Times you have to buy premium means what its not a free and fun game if you will need to buy it then why don't you make it premium in playstore only I request you to remove that features and let everyone play guess rare characters to win in tournament thank you hope you will improve,Yes,Humor,
Its really fun for some reason. Its not like im the one being challenged but its fun and addictive. It'd be better if the result pic would be bigger coz some characters have good pictures i wanna see clearly LMAO,Yes,Humor,
"I think this game is funny but it's fun to challenge Akinator and I love it that it gives you different choices like, people, movies, animals, and I think it was supplies anyway it's a really fun game. Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
I lts awesome but I think the game can hear through the phone cuz everytime I say the answer it's correct and if not I have to do a second try soooooo it MIGHT BE cheating.....but some times its the other way around so yeah...,Yes,Humor,
"It's really frustrating that he got my characters, especially Mikaela from Owari no seraph, I hadn't expect him to get that since it's a pretty old anime but he did! It surprised me but it's really fun to come up with the new characters and people for him to guess",Yes,Humor,
Very fun game. Surprisingly full of obscure characters and people. Would've given it 4 stars but I don't like the stupid VIP thing. I only have to watch an ad though. Could be worse.,Yes,Humor,
This is the m0oo0stst piecre of tracshh ever. I rather eat out of the garbage than play this game. No one should ever have to spend money on him guessing a stupid character. The company who made this piece of trash game are complete idiots. I also have to mention that they made me usey data on this game even though I bought this game on another device and they didn't make me use data or internet. This game is one of the worst games ever I definitely do not recommend this piece of garbage anyone.,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
I love this app! This app actually reads my mind! And its also very fun! Wouldnt say anything more because there are ni glithes! Ads dont make me annoyed really much because there arent that many ads! Love the game,Yes,Humor,
Wow great app. Shame that all obscure characters are behind a paywall. The point of the apl is to try and beat it. You'd think an app which relied on user inout to function for years if it didnt have it in the database would be more charitbale to the userbase. Stopped being fun the fifth time it was behind the paywall,Yes,Humor,
"This game is fun but I have to watch an ad, and at the end akinator ends up up saying ""I don't know what that is"" So its a ad for nothing it is frustrating. But its fun but I'd like more questions",Yes,Humor,
"Very fun app, especially to play with my Family and friends. one thing I must add though is that it tends to trap me even if the character that it says was not the one I was thinking of, even if it was.",Yes,Humor,
"So if you pick easy ones it isnt fun and you are unlikely to get awards, but the game punishes you for picking ones that are hard by not giving you awards if Aki guesses wrong. I've had him guess wrong several times and it is annoying.",Yes,Humor,
"I like this game. Its very fun to play. But I would like 1 thing to be added, It would be great if There was a ""Game"" Theme, It would be amazing if it was added. But I have no other problem so I rate this game 5 stars. Thank you. Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
yes i love how it reeds my mind and rewouds love app i think more people shoudl get it. you get it on phone iphad compurter anthing bascly and it phone for childre teenager and parnets anyone sept from babys and newborn because that it dangeras because of light it could damig there isitt it could make them blind. i love this game so much i cant stop playing on it it so fun everone should get it sept from baby. thank you and remeber to keep safe,Yes,Humor,
The game is fun but they are so money hungry. Tons and tons of ads that gets in the buttons way and some characters require the premium version to access,Yes,Humor,
"I love this app, it's almost eerie how much it can guess. Could do with less ads, but as a free and fun app, I can't complain.",Yes,Humor,
. When i was choosing a person i got the VIP tab. And they were getting really close to close to the aswer then i got the VIP tab. When I try to click the ad button IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK. Disappointed,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"its fun off course but what really made me upset is how whenever i get anything above silver rank characters, it wont register them into my badges as higher rank characters. its very annoying and makes me feel unaccomplished.",Yes,Humor,
I like it its fun but there are way to many ads take out the ads and ill rate it a 5 completely plz stop the ads it not as good with the ads thats why i gave it a three im sorry but way to many ads Sadly its not a five but i still like playing to try to make him guess me plz say yes if u agree,Yes,Humor,
"fun, but there are some glitches. every time we win a VIP character, it says pay $5 or watch an ad, but we cannot click the watch ad button it doesn't work.",Yes,Humor,
It used to be good but now it's horrible. It would be fun but the fact you need to pay money to get some people the Akinator can guess is stupid. The VIP is fine but don't make it that important. May as well just make the game cost money if you're gonna do that.,Yes,Humor,
It is quiet a fun game....and hopefully it really works most of the time.....another good thing about this is that you can play this game with your family and friends to have some fun.Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ But the only problem is the VIP needs. But it's not really a big problem. Nice app. Happy with it.Ã°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
"Used to be a really fun app. But now it's quite bad at guessing, and if you pick anyone too obscure it makes you watch an ad before it reveals the guess.",Yes,Humor,
"It's a good and reliable game quite enjoyable but i agree with the others, if we can only play in offline because it's really disappointing it would be great i already shared it with my friends but it's getting really boring a lot",Yes,Humor,
"This game is fun, but I'm being penalized for guessing elusive and hard people. If I land on someone to quickly or easily they reject my idea and make accusations that I'm just trying to scam an award.",Yes,Humor,
"This is a really fun game, most of the questions are mostly a yes, no or don't know question for me. Akinator asks some silly questions too. But really really fun and exciting game. I would say keep up the good work.",Yes,Humor,
"a good fun app. but if your are playing to get on the leaderboard, where one must make akinator guess the character in the first attempt.. its get irritating over time when the stupid bot wastes questions and repeats questions ...",Yes,Humor,
You cant get all charecters in the daily challenge. It dosent let you. I got 4 out of 5 characters but i also got the fifth character but it was showing it was not on the board but when i checked the next day that was the last charecter. It is a fun game bit has a lot of issues with it,Yes,Humor,
"The app used to work so well before, what happend? Now when I try to load akinator, the screen just go's white and says ""try again"" I press it then I just crashed. I am disappointed",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"The app is good and all but it used to be insanely good. Like you seriously made VIP characters so that we had to watch and add or pay 5 dollars to find out what you guessed, like that's retarted.",Yes,Passive-Aggression,
It is really awesome and it so good way to pass your time! It is so funny because it almost can read your mind and it really can! Thank you so much to you all who made this Game/App. Thank you! Ã°ÂÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¥Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
"Now this is an app/game which really helps people to find their character and famous people. Fun and addicting, but I mostly appreciate the developers for the always up to date anime characters.",Yes,Humor,
It was really fun till it glitched and it said you could be thinking of a rare or something character watch an add or pay to see and the add thing never worked I left and re opened my game triple checked my wifi everything was fine but the add wouldn't load,Yes,Humor,
"it's honestly so easy to guess... like, he asks so many questions until it's literally freaking obvious what it is, but it's still a fun game, its fun to see if he even knows the character your thinking of.",Yes,Humor,
"The game itself is fun and interesting and it has a great concept but the people you can actually guess most of the time are blocked by the ""this is a vip character, to see the character you must get VIP or watch a video.""To watch a video is fine but you only get 2 vids per day and that limits of who you can have Akinator geuss.",Yes,Humor,
This app is so much fun when I started playing it I couldn't stop. This game is so fun you should get it it's so much fun it has a child filter which will protect us and it's really fun the only downside is you can't turn off the child filter but still it's a fun game,Yes,Humor,
A lot of fun. Big improvements over the original version. Only complaint is not giving awards for daily challenges.,Yes,Humor,
This game is awesome even you can choose the option like there are options that you can only gets about TV shows characters and many more this is awesome,Yes,Humor,
"Its really fun to play! Theres a tiny bug but its fine. The genie isnt even there, its just a hat and clothes. Its.. really weird. But i love how it guesses what your thinking!!",Yes,Humor,
"So much fun to see if you can stump Akinator. My family all loves it. We play together and enjoy trying to come up with weird, strange, unique ways to stump him. But he's too good...",Yes,Irony,
I've been waiting for 10 minutes to get in the app. When I did open the app it would not stop loading and so I couldn't play it. I'm very disappointed with this app i hope this issue will be fixed,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"The app is very interesting and excellent.When you will use the app for the first time, you will be surely thrilled watching his guessing power. But you must give him the true information.",Yes,Flattery,
"It's really fun , in my opinion I've seen reviews and they are all really helpful this app makes me laugh I see so many people with it I have a shot and I abaoulotely love it .I love the fact you can do movie characters and yourself ect it's amazingly fun 100% recommend",Yes,Humor,
"It is so cool and amazing app! It makes me happy and fresh and i get so stunned when it finds out that i am thinking, I laugh so much when i play it. But the only thing i dont like is it asks same questions some time. Plz fix this! THANK YOU",Yes,Flattery,
"Really it's very amazing game. I really enjoyed it, and i really don't know how can they read our mind correctly.i played this game several times and it give me the answers correctly. Love this game Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â super duper interesting game it was!!!!Ã°ÂÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¨Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ.",Yes,Flattery,
"I like the game although, the amount of ads are annoying. I have fun one time and another but I don't like the ads.",Yes,Humor,
Fix you're technical errors it won't let me open the app to play anymore. Waste of time trying which is sad because it's an awesome game.,Yes,Humor,
"Every character is ""vip"" now so you have to watch a video every time just to see it's first guess, or pay a bunch of money. I'm uninstalling because of this, it isn't fun anymore.",Yes,Humor,
What a great game and it's very funny he can really read your mind i just downloaded it a minute ago and i really enjoyed it so far the thing is there's a lot of ads and i hope they will fix this but so far it's a good game,Yes,Humor,
This game can never gess the person or YouTuber.Also there never on the list.It only gessed right on Azzyland and Wengi it never works.I hope if you get Akinator it will gess your person right. So you can give it more stars and more people can play it to have fun with it.Ã¢ÂÂ¥Ã¯Â¸Â,Yes,Humor,
"Such a cool game and very fun, and it amazes me how he is even able to guess unkown characters from Dbz like Nail, I thought he would guess piccolo. Anyways still enthusiastic but the only problem are the ads",Yes,Humor,
"This app sucks, way too many ads, and it makes you watch unskippable ads for the answer. Just use the website. The app is trash.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Despite the game being about it's ability to predict a character it punishes and actively disuades you from thinking of a ""rare"" character by offering less to no rewards compared to normal characters and making you only watch the god awful ads for these rare characters.",Yes,Irony,
Very veryy clever app!!Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ... I really like it a lot and it is fun to play...I would prefer this app to u all so that it should be Fun !! I love this app and this app has Less ads also loving it thankyou : ),Yes,Humor,
"Will ask you the same questions they've just asked you multiple time and gives you characters that have traits he asked you about and have blatantly said no to, plus for some reason you can only get the rewards for saying characters if he guessed them on his first try which is insanely counterintuitive considering the rewards are based of how rare the characters are to be guessed therefore how difficult it is for him to guess them, don't waste your time on this trash",Yes,Passive-Aggression,
pretty fun most of the time but a few times they would ask if my character was from a specific franchise and I would say no but they would still guess a character from that franchise as their first guess and screwing me out of the badge :p,Yes,Humor,
"Trash. Why are extremely well-known characters ""VIP""? Plus, he takes way too long to guess most of the time. Game is often laggy and has too many ads.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This app is amazing. Unimaginable for all the tricks! It's good for free time and I highly recommend it. I actually didn't think he'd actually get the characters I thought of, but it's a very nice app.",Yes,Flattery,
"The game is great but before i refreshed my phone,it always kicked me out and its a bit creepy as he ""reads your mind"" Its an excellent game tho,i do recommend it .Please fix some of the bugs",Yes,Flattery,
"Using this was fun for the first 3 tries, but after that I kept getting ""VIP character"" and was required to pay or watch a video and the video would not come up.",Yes,Humor,
Trash app unplayable because too many apps. Developer got greedy. Imagine watching a 1 min video just to see that it guessed the wrong character.,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
Awesome. So far. Got everything right. Creepily accurate. Hopefully it'll never be used to spy on people. Aki awesomeness! This app is spectacular! Keep amazing the world.,Yes,Humor,
Hello let my start saying its really fun I love it but for me on a mobile when I starting it now its not loading Idk if its on my side so I uninstalled it and installed it angin but its still not working Ã°ÂÂÂ oo and the ads can u cut them please that will be all I have to say but its a really nice game Ã°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
I really like this game and Akinator does most of the time read your mind but he keeps asking the same thing example im thinking of DanTDM he asks if he has blue hair i say yes then a few seconds later he says does you character have blonde hair then its green ecs but i do think its really fun and i like playing the game,Yes,Humor,
This game is really good and fun. But when you choose every thing you know in the universe it's gonna be kinda hard to play because you tried every thing.,Yes,Humor,
oh my god i have never seen such a app before my god it guesses whatever i thing i asked it 5 times it gaves always write answer i love it and i never delete this app . thanks for launching app like this . please install it . first i thinked that like all it will be fake but i was completely wrong . its unbelievable that this type of app is actually existed. plase makes other apps like this . slowly it goes to the topic and then find it,Yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This is just awesome and very addictive, loved that it modifying the new information too and great use of AI technology. Looking forward to more flawless form of this app by asking minimum questions and suggesting accurate answers.",Yes,Humor,
"This game is really fun, it's like playing 20 questions, without having to remember all of the answers you're given, because you're the one giving all the answers. My only question for the devs is...what happens when you have one that akinator can't guess....and is nowhere on the following list?",Yes,Humor,
This game is really fun! I really like that you don't just have to people. I saw many YouTuber's do this and I wanted to try it out for myself. It's really cool how the Akinator guess's.,Yes,Humor,
Wow. I'm actually seriously impressed that it got prerty much all of them. It only missed one out of the other million characters that I made him guess. This is actually pretty fun bth. I would definitely recomend it. Ã°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
This game is just amazing whatever I think it guesses it correctly and exactly the same. Even the animated characters and real characters also.,Yes,Flattery,
"This game is OK it sucks that a lot of the characters are vip and it's not even amazing all the app does is when you awnser questions it just searches it up online so for everyone who thinks it's ""amazing"" use you brain and think.",Yes,Flattery,
"Fun for a bit but too many characters are VIP, which wouldn't be as much of an issue if the ads didn't crash the app",Yes,Humor,
"Brilliant! The bad reviews are not true. You dont NEED to get VIP, it just ASKS you if you WANT it to see locked answers. Also, if it says it is not your charecter, DONT GET MAD! It is very easy for him to get it right, there is almost no ads and it makes you think ""Woah, how could he guess that?"". Overall very fun, calming and Exciting. Yours sincerely, Galaxy Rainbow Girl. Bye! Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
Ok so this is a Awesome app! It's so much fun and there is kid locks so it is safe for your kids I Ave so much fun he guessed ALL of my characters (Hamilton cast) Its free and out can collect coins and mealds it's so Cool!!!,Yes,Humor,
"It is cheating.It has a mic. So if you say your character out loud it will guess it right.So just think about your character in your mind.But it is fun, and I do recommend it.",Yes,Humor,
"Fun to play on my home, it does take some time to guess what character or person I'm thinking of. I've also heard that there has been trouble with signing in and I have experienced the same thing.",Yes,Humor,
"I was having fun until getting VIP Characters becase common place. It ruined it, if you're going to shove ads down someones throat why also add a VIP system? Especially for a game like this. it just ruins it.",Yes,Humor,
I can read really fast and answer really fast so it always thinks that I'm answering randomly so to get akiawards I have to be really patient but other than that the app is pretty fun. Pls fix problem,Yes,Humor,
Akinator is one of the best apps on google play i really had fun with it but my only problem is that every time I open the game it downloads the same file every time it's so annoying please fix it,Yes,Humor,
I like it so much I Play it all the time but now I don't everytime I Play it and challenge animator the freaking VIP shows on the whole screen it used to be so fun and I loved challenging the akinator with weird things and get surprised when he figures it out now it's no fun at all,Yes,Humor,
It is amazing it can read your mind no time but be careful read the questions because it might be the same but the worst part is that there's to many adds but still amazing so I give it five stars,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
This is so aweSOME it's like SOMEone is controlling it SOME games don't have this SOME people might have issues but this game is aweSOME don't mind me making the word SOME big letters and also SOME of the you tubers like it like dantdm he litterely beat you thrice SOME people can't do it SOME people can anyways its aweSOME I really like the game thanks for making it you guys are great/aweSOME,Yes,Humor,
"Seems to block guessing characters/people who are gay from the kid friendly version... Why? When checking the same on the unlocked version the reveal is made, and most cases correct, but literally nothing that is unsuitable for children, just a name. Strange behaviour, I'll delete to avoid funding through watching adverts...",Yes,Humor,
it is a nice game what so ever i think it can guess it by questioning. Some times in the first go it wouldnt be able to get which charecter i put in mind . But very excellent gameÃ°ÂÂÂ(^Ã¯Â½Â^)Ã¯Â¼Â¯(Ã¢ÂÂ§Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¦)Ã¯Â¼Â¯,Yes,Flattery,
This is insane. The ads come after many rounds and are skippable but the guessing. Wow. It's guessed right everytime. I'm very impressed,Yes,Passive-Aggression,
its alil fun. but at times it forces you to watch ads and if you dont it makes you start all over again from question one. kinda lame,Yes,Humor,
"I think The app Is Trash, I didn't say The Akinator Trash Coz Akinator is Awesome, But The App Is So Trash. Iam Going to Web Again. In The Website There Only Some Ads But In The App everytime 1 add 30s. Then i have to wait 15s to skip. If You Don't Want The ad Then You Have to Pay 350BDT, i don't need it, iam going back to the web.",Yes,Humor,
If it actually didn't crash every time ya tried to play it maybe the game would be fun idk if it's a over all problem or a Google pixel problem but fix your damn app if your going to force users to use it instead of the online,Yes,Humor,
It's pretty interesting. Akinator does guess most of your characters. I had an enjoyable experience and will personally come back for more. That's why I gave Akinator five stars.,Yes,Humor,
THis is a great app. i always play with my friend while we are calling. its so fun that it can read your mind! everyone can play it its so fun!,Yes,Humor,
I dont like the fact that you have to buy stuff or the characters that are VIP and you have to watch a video or pay Like Coach Hedge is a VIP character but Percy Jackson isn't But other then that this is amazing it will guess everything (or mostly) you should get the app,Yes,Flattery,
This game is awesome! I've got so many people to try it and its guessed all of them 5 star no lag the V.I.P. Watch an ad for the V.I.P. is fine because its still go the character even if it was V.I.P. Awesome game love it keep up the good work.,Yes,Humor,
"It is quite a fun app. 60% Of the time, It guesses it right.-w- 30 % Of the time, it guesses it wrong. %10 Of the time. ""You have guessed a special character! Buy premium Potion to see what character."" overall..... Its---{ i keep the secret.. no!..} i Eh. improve. now.",Yes,Humor,
"I really like the browser game, it's very fun, but this doesn't load, I reinstalled several times and the game never got past the first loading screen",Yes,Humor,

"It was fun, at times. It can be really annoying if you get a VIP character, but it's fine, and I recommend it, kinda.",Yes,Humor,
"Neat gimmick, horrible execution. This is one of the WORST aged snippets of the past decade, and it's entirely the fault of the creators. Let's pretend that dressing your genie as a stereotype of Native Americans, complete with a war bonnet is fine. So is the use of male pronouns everywhere to the point of being uncomfortable instead of just saying they. So is the cashgrabby nature of the game. So are all the ridiculous restrictions on getting meaningless points..Oh, wait. That's all it has.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"It was fun but then it asked for my location. I was very confused as to why this app would need my location, so I denied. When you deny it, the app won't work at all.",Yes,Humor,
"So for me, It's a really fun game to play but it does have a lot of ads but most of them you can skip. It's a good for when you are bored and want something to do.",Yes,Humor,
"To be honest this game is a complete trash , Actually I don't even know how the game works and what we have to do etc. Coz the game says something error and it kicks me out the game after a a lot of tries the game opens and it keeps on loading after like a 30min the app opens and I went washroom and again, what theÃ°ÂÂ¤Â¬Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¬Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¬Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¬the app kicks me out of the game like what??????? And because of my best friend request to play this game I tried this idiot game coz you idiot guys I wasted my precious 1hour.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
This is an amazing app. It really does seem like magic. It seems like he's going nowhere then suddenly he asks one pivotal question and he gets it every time!,Yes,Flattery,
Its a fun game! but it only lets you guess so many times that after you guess the limit you have to pay or watch a video to see who he guessed.,Yes,Humor,
"It is an AWESOME game!Ã°ÂÂÂ® except I'm not gonna lie, after playing it for a while it gets kinda boring. But it is CRAZY {I mean it can guess realllllllyyyy hard celebs. I recommend this game!",Yes,Humor,
Sorry but I know how it's working and it's may be simple if have some general knowledge......I played min 10 but one's he answered.....but if have all knowledge for the character then I think it's definitely works.... Overall fun gameÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
I was depressed but playing this app improved my mood. It's impossible to beat this game and to be honest I thought that it was not possible that he can read my mind but he did. He is amazing!!,Yes,Flattery,
"Used to be a really fun game but now the object of the game is to have a rare character, but if you get a rare character you have to pay or watch videos to see it. You literally have to pay to win",Yes,Humor,
it was an awesome battle between us. I did loose to him every time but there was a fun in losing to him. this is a great app. I totally rate it 5 stars,Yes,Humor,
"Its amazing and its so crazy and sometimes frecky when akinator guessing what in thinking of, if it be the randomest of the random or the most guessable of the guessness, anyways, its a amazing game and not so more you can do to make it bettet than just make the guessing robot on the game more smarter and make it better and make a higher charge of it guessing what you are guessing of",Yes,Flattery,
This app is amazing I've been using it since 2015 or 14 and it's great but a lot of the time whenever I do a hard character then it ends up being vip and there's no ad available,Yes,Flattery,
"I really like this app because it can read your mind. He guessed what I was thinking. I was thinking Princess and the Frog, Moana, Luca, and I really dont remember what else, I just know the Akinator guessed that.This is really why I love this app. You should download it. It is really good and really awesome.",Yes,Humor,
"Really fun game, will almost guess everything right,which is really mind blowing! The only thing to dislike is that it has got many adds!",Yes,Humor,
It's a very awesome app what I think it answer all but sometime it takes tooooooooooo much time like if it's answers are wrong I am over 20 but it thinks I am only 10. So when I think of somebody it always answer your younger cousin or I am thinking about my friend it says your friends father Ã°ÂÂÂ¬Ã°ÂÂÂ¬.,Yes,Humor,
Amazing!!I love it! I suggest you have it!but the thing is that everytime i I press something I don't know about it start loading but I think it's my device,Yes,Flattery,
"Worlds's frist good app for children....... I give it 5 stars and everyone also should give it 5 stars.....

"The ad on the V.I.P. characters doesn't work, so I'm obligated to pay you with my dirty money. It's incredible how easily can a great app become garbage.",Yes,Flattery,
"Fun experience but when you have a ""VIP"" answer you are either forced to watch a video or buy the VIP version that js $2. I neccesariy dont mind the ads but when you watch enough of them for the ""VIP"" answer, i tells you you dont have anymore videos to watch lractically maming you buy the version or wait fkr the videos to refresh. Overall fun",Yes,Humor,
"It used to be fun and great but now it has become boring. While guessing, it asks same questions again and again. That kills the charm and wastes many questions.",Yes,Humor,
this game is awful you can't see what he thinks your person is unless you pay ÃÂ£3.99 or watch an advert and when you try to watch an add it doesn't do it 99% off the time don't bother getting this game,Yes,Irony,
Amazing experience. He guessed most of the people I chose. Very fun and kinda spooky how he knew everything haha. Overall an amazing game. Thank you!,Yes,Humor,
"It's the worst! Its says a technical problen has occurred with your device, but my phone is 1 week old, it has no problems! This * app is so stupid!!! Ã°ÂÂÂ¤Ã°ÂÂÂ¤ Close it down! Do not install!! Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ¼Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ¼Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ¼",Yes,Self-Deprecation,

SO I CLICK YES ON IT AND IT SAYS THAT I ""FAILED THE VALIDATION CHECK."" I WAS IN THE TOP TEN WITH OVER 1000 POINTS AND THE DAMN GAME GAVE ME A VALIDATION CHECK OF THE CHARACTER I WAS TRYING TO GUESS AND IT DROPPED ME TO 250 POINTS AND 120TH PLACE IN THE RANKINGS. AND THIS ISNT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED",Yes,Humor,
Pretty fun game but when i tried to get a black character i finally did which was the purple orcas leader from black clover it didnt even show i was on there then once i refreshed new person got it and i didnt even get to see it,Yes,Humor,

"This game is very interesting and I enjoyed it too much...the akinator is too clever.. it's true that it can reads our mind.... Sometimes,l will be shocked that how it can reads our mind... it's really an amazing game",Yes,Flattery,

"It's was fun, but he would 'test you' to see if you were lying about your choice. Of course, it made sense, but it's a kids game, not some gambling game where you could win money. So, why does he need to test you? Again, just a kids game.",Yes,Humor,
I usually don't give any reviews but this is one of the very very few apps which is truly amazing. I downloaded it and playing for last one hour. Magic app.,Yes,Flattery,

I like this game this is a great game I had a lot of fun Ã°ÂÂÂ Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂ¤Â©,Yes,Humor,
"Really fun game to play, not very buggy in my experience. Really enjoy it!!",Yes,Humor,
It's trash every time I enter they kick me out I tried it 50 time in a row and it glitched luckily I fixed it pls fix it,Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"Alot of funn and intresting app , that makes time pass by and enables you of having fun with others, ...",Yes,Humor,
this app is AMAZING it guesses your chareter 90/100 percent. how it works is your think of someone or a cartoon ( remeber it doesnt have to be alive) then akanator asks questions and trys to guess your charecter if he doesnt you can contiune or tell him your charecter. I defiently recommend becuase you also can get rewards too.,Yes,Flattery,
"Pretty drink but way too many ads. I opened the game for the first time after downloading and before I could do anything, there was an ad. I pressed the play button, ad. I chose a drink, ad. Pushed the back button to choose another drink, ad. Choose a drink, ad. Way too many ads. It makes the app so much less functional.",Yes,Humor,
"Um it's really fun and all but when it caught changing the drinks and picking other drinks that add starts coming in... Everything is I really love the app it's just the ads. Okay the eyes has gone out of control like every time I want to change a simple drink and add comes up you don't know how annoying that is. A beautiful star but once the ads start coming down then, I will give it a five star! Four stars are good enough right? Yes it is so please fix the ads.. it's kind of really annoying.",Yes,Humor,
This app is terrible! All the drink do is just move the surface of the water around in a straight line of bubbles! It's not like the ads at all! And speaking of ads. This game has so many you can even count them. I turn on the game BOOM ad. That one finishes.. BOOM another one. And only then can you play the game. I thought this would be a fun and relaxing but it isnt!,Yes,Irony,
"This is a pretty fun game, good for pranking your friends and stuff. I dont like how many ads there is and then the icon at the top of the screen to change drinks kind of annoys me because it makes it look unreal at times, I do love that you can put in your own ingredients and test our your own drinks! Ã¢Â­Â Ã¢Â­Â Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Â",Yes,Humor,
"Hi, can you please get rid of the forced ads? They're pretty frustrating. I opened the app and got an ad, then clicked on one of the drinks that I liked the look of and BOOM, another ad. It also lags a lot but I just got a new, really good phone for Christmas, so I don't understand why it's lagging? I don't think it should unless this is just the app. The rest of the game looks quite good and fun to use but the adverts and lag ruined it a bit Ã°ÂÂÂ. Thanks for reading my review, enjoy your day. Bye",Yes,Humor,
"This app is amazing but there is only one problem, there's too many adds I give a 4 star rating because it puts the same ad I've watched every single time I pick a drink. Yet it still comes to where it did the same ad over and over againÃ°ÂÂÂ I like it but I didn't want to see all the ads I've watched over and over. GoodBye!Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Flattery,
"This game is really fun and great! Just a few requests, maybe lessen the ads? I understand that you people who made the game need money, but the amount of ads are driving me crazy!!! (I've read the other reviews, they've got the same problem!) Well that's all I have to say, Thank you so much for creating this game and working hard on it. :) Btw, happy new year!!!! Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â",Yes,Humor,
Used to be a fun game I had downloaded it for my little brother but I deleted it because of all the ads they suddenly put in and all the fruits are locked now and the only way to unlock it is to watch more ads it even pops up ads when you dont even click anything. Not playable there are so many ads:/,Yes,Humor,
This game is just very exiting. And it may contain ads but it is okay and I do really not care that the ads might just pop-up out of nowhere. Super cool and also very refreshing and relaxing. I feel like I am really drinking my drinks from the phone. Super awesome!!!Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ,Yes,Humor,
I'm telling you it would have been a five-star if there weren't so many ads like the amount of ads is just crazy but I really really love this app and it's so fun there's a little problem when you click on icon I thought it would let you change it it's just toppings for your drink,Yes,Humor,
"This game is fun but every time I drink something it starts going out the other end, then I put my mouth to that end but It just goes the other end again. I'm on Samsung so I don't know if it's just the device. But I like the game because I prank my family a lot and they think it's funny. Please improve on that problem and the game will be perfect. Thanks!",Yes,Humor,
"I enjoy the game. Mabye I wouldn't play it for fun, but if I am bored (Rarely) I would go to this game. I do not spend more time in this app than expected, but it's a working progress. The app does not let me watch offline, I have to be on the game or if I am distracted it kicks me out. The app does have User Reviews, but I think it has too many ads. I reccomend the gameÃ¢ÂÂ¤",Yes,Humor,
"This app is fun, but there are WAY TO MANY ADS. I havent really checked out the app that much, but I think there is a *Remove ads* button. If there isnt, I would like it if you guys could so there is no apps. Still very good.",Yes,Humor,
I would have rated it five stars if it wasn't rated mature 17+. Good app anyways. It looks so real. The liquid goes away like it's in your mouth. Amazing app. Also four stars because ads pop up every time you press a button that isn't selecting customization.,Yes,Flattery,
"it's awesome, there are many options and I can choose my chilling cocktail. during summer morning when I want to have my chilling glass but it's not possible at the moment,. It makes me feel that I am really having my chilling glass of cocktail. and I can add ice cubes and fruits in my cocktail. I love the filling sound and the ending sound when the cocktail is finished.

"Way to many ads so I can't have fun all day like it says good music, cool drinking vibes but I'll have to bring my five star rating down to a 3 star rating, all because of the adsÃ°ÂÂÂ¥",Yes,Humor,
"Before you use this useless app, you have to read dozen pages of terms & agree to everything including giving excess to all the files,photos,videos on your phone to use them as they pleased, it's amazing how people agree to these conditions & its even more amazing that Google let them have control of all these personal information when there is no need, THANK YOU Google, GOOD JOB PROTECTING YOUR USERS. Also they state your personal information is send to China",Yes,Flattery,
"Its really fun tho.there are many people's that say the ads are bla bla.but the ads are not breaking the game.even i drink and ads on it i don't care if there are many ads.its okay.i fell like a'm on the beach and like a cool place.i really really like it.i unlock all the fruits and use the ads to unlock the fruits.i rate it 5 because its fun,relaxing and enjoying.even i don't have wifi its nothing wrong its the same!.Ã°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,

"I like this app, its fun to play.Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
"OK. So here's mine... Tried to install it few times, it took times, several times. Even have to move to gain more signal, but it didn't. Tried restarting it, still none. Then, after a while, found something useful. At last, after a few moments, it freed me from boresome. Its amazing how a great featire pack into just a few megs. It even gave me free wallpaper. Thumbs up.",Yes,Flattery,
"Awesome app. It's very entertaining and, nicely designed. The buttons in the game are not to small and not to large. The buttons are also nice colors. There is a part in the game that is so awesome and amazing that I fell off my chair while playing it at work, there is a word on screen that says Ã¢ÂÂNothingÃ¢ÂÂ first of all, the grammer is correct and second of all, the font is nice. The color (Which is black) is a great color choice. Best game in app history.",Yes,Humor,
"Amazing and immersive graphics. I'm having a hard time with level 4, but at least I got the Commodore's key so I can at least get off the ship. The soundtrack to this game really makes it hard to put down. Any truth about this game coming to Xbox or PS?",Yes,Flattery,
"This game is incredible. The graphics are stunning. I also like character development and the soundtrack. I downloaded it not that long ago, but I'm getting close to the boss. The only thing I'd reccomend is making the loading screen faster.",Yes,Flattery,
"Gorgeous, brilliant, amazing, this is one of the best app out there, it easy to use and really useful, whenever i feel bad i just open this and chill, really recommend The color of the background just blend perfectly together with the black front making a breath taking view, there are only one word for the graphic and music Ã¢ÂÂ¨ P E R F E C T I O NÃ¢ÂÂ¨",Yes,Flattery,
This is the most fun experience I had in a app the story straight down to the action and weapons and characters I wish it was a little more complex though like try adding puzzels to get to the boss room or add more characters it has a massive map a bunch of side missions and tons of npcs best app ever.,Yes,Humor,
This game is amazing. It gas a lot of types of characters to choose from. The graphics are real smooth too. There are so many quest. This game really keeps you busy. It's the perfect game to play when you are bored. Great work!,Yes,Flattery,
"This game is amazing! Outstanding graphics, extremely fun, and I will never get tired of it! I reccomend you to download this app. Although there are a few glitches, it is very fun to play and neverending joy! The map is huge! Good gameplay mechanics too! This is the best game I have ever seen in my entire life!",Yes,Humor,
"Oh my this app is amazing! The characters are perfect and the gameplay is simple. The storyline is excellent all while taking little to no space at all in your phone. I spend HOURS on this game, super fun to play!",Yes,Humor,
"It says that it does nothing but when I opened the app in the dark, my screen started working as a flashlight which helped me get out of the bedroom without tripping over something so the app does nothing is actually a false claim. Totally disappointed but I'll still drop 5 stars because I have high expectations from the developers.",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
Best game ever the zombies were overpowered but the upgrade after buying M416 was really cool but the boss wasn't too hard to defeat after level 7 and the lady after level 2 helped a lot but she killed my dog by the way very nice game after all there is very cool features and pretty awesome and beautiful places and the best was after level 49 pretty cool keep making these type of games keep it up but who ever is downloading this game I want to tell you that there is nothing to do we all werejoke,Yes,Humor,
"A life changing experience . When I opened the app I felt the power and knowledge in my veins. I know the universes deepest corners I can sense anything. I am currently using 100% of my brain . The graphics , sound effects all the details gone into this app was amazing 11/10 would reccomend",Yes,Flattery,
This game is absolutely beautiful and amazing. The graphics are stunning and the UI is so easy-to-use. I even get 420 FPS on a Nokia phone! It is also very minimal which is also the reason I love this app!,Yes,Flattery,
"Okay that was very quick, if i even played right. I shook my phone 100 times, i was done fairly quick. But it was really fun. Im posting this before i decide whether i should try to leave it on for a uncertain amount of time. Again this was really fun. Im going to go now, bye. Edit: i figured it out, banana song is gonna be a new favourite.",Yes,Humor,
"This was the most epic game i have ever played!!! I thought level 4 was a little hard land i got stuck for some time. But the graphics, soundtrack, and everything else were such perfection! Truly an amazing game, and would reccomend to everyone!!!!!!",Yes,Flattery,
"I am actually mystified by the world that was created in this app. Some may think the whole point is shaking the phone, or even swiping the screen to unlock buttons, but the real point is using those hints to help unlock the game (incredible btw I'm on level 284) but please dont write a bad reveiw if you dont understand the game, because this game does not deserve less than a 5. So download nothing, play the game, and have the world of nothing take you away from reality.",Yes,Flattery,
"I had to make a PowerPoint presentation about an application, and I chose this one! The comments and the whole game is just so amazing, it really does make a good presentation to show my whole class!",Yes,Flattery,
It is SO much fun. ONLY reason it isn't 5 stars is because there are wayyyyy to many ads I don't enjoy the ads but the fortnite and minecraft aspect of the game is amazing THIS LITTERALLY CHANGED MY LIFE! I once got 12 trophy from dying I MEAN flying.... I'm good I swear.,Yes,Humor,
"Worth it to play? Yes! This game is amazing, physics are good, cash is almost impossible to get and graphics are amazing! This is better than any game on the game store!!! This game is really cool and fun!",Yes,Humor,
"This app is amazing nice vibe, really classy and a chilled app. it's really simple all you have to do is sit there looking at the word ""Nothing"" and it's actually cool because you do it to!",Yes,Flattery,
"One u get past the tricky first level of the nothing page its really fun, great graphics and animations made a lot of friends.",Yes,Humor,
"I love the user interface, wish this was available in dark mode tho but other than that it is super fun and I would highly recommend it!!",Yes,Humor,
You thought games like zelda breath of the wild and gta 5 had a deep expansive map with intriguing gameplay think not cause this app crushes those games in every fundamental way. (You really get what you paid for),Yes,Humor,
All the comments you see about amazing graphics and gameplay are sarcastic and supposed to be funny. This app was made for fun and it does just that.,Yes,Humor,
"Life changing story, great gameplay and incredible graphics. Truly the best game I ever got to play. Title fits perfectly too! Props to the dev(s) for this incredible experience. Fully deserved 5 stars, would gladly rate again",Yes,Flattery,
"It was a really fun app. I love how when you press in the top right corner it gets to a fun kitten merging game. A truly beautiful app. Jokes aside, its exactly what it says on the tin. There shouldn't be any bad reviews, because it doesnt lie about what it is. The whole point of it is that its nothing, and the people giving bad reviews because it's nothing shouldn't be complaining, because you have to search for the game to find it!",Yes,Humor,
"To everyone saying this app has no use, you are wrong. It is actually quite useful. I use this app when I clean my phone's screen because if it's pressed it won't do anything, and if anyone asks what I'm doing I can just pull up the app and show them the screen. This app is not useless. It is amazing.",Yes,Flattery,
"It really is useless. U just shake shake shake your phone and the background changes and it looks fun in the beginning but there're not more than 20/30 slides. So once you're done exploring all the slides, you're done there.",Yes,Humor,
"Best app ever!!! the Graphics, Sound Effects, Designs, and the Entire App itself is Amazing!!! can't wait for the next update!",Yes,Flattery,
"OH MY GOD THIS APP CHANGED MY LIFE. Super interactive, there's no glitches, no bugs, and is super fun. My friends and I love this app. I would recommend.",Yes,Humor,
Probably the best app I've had so far. Interface is awesome. Can't forget about that smooth animation. Love it!!!,Yes,Humor,
"This app is amazing I can't stop playing this app has so much you can do, but there's not enough outfits and when I'm trying to beat boss I die and I need a weapon that's strong that has barely any chance of spawning sad",Yes,Flattery,
Just beautiful graphics overall. Amazing music and I've never had a better mobile game.,Yes,Flattery,
this is an amazing life changing app with the power to potentially teach you true peace of mind and the power of trusting yourself and the decisions you make. i believe this app is the reason i was able to get rid of my addiction to the dreaded marijuana and save myself from the depression ive been fighting since day one thanks to the creator of this app you have made me and more than a million others better than they were before downloading this app,Yes,Flattery,
"Just incredible, the graphic, music, gameplay all of it. I wonder how long to make such masterpiece because it would be the best game of all time, no words can be describe as to how amazing this game is and how it mesmerise me for the first time I open it. very incredible",Yes,Flattery,
This app is amazing. I 100% recommend installing this on every device capable of installing nothing. Keep up the great work on the app.,Yes,Flattery,
"Amazing graphics, all the characters have unique personalities and designs. Myah is my favorite character so far, but I am very sad that Jamie died... Just reached the castle. Hopefully I can save Mike and Abby from the Orca Gang. The storyline is also very well written and it pleases me. Wish me luck to finish the game and get the good ending! Ã°ÂÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ",Yes,Irony,
"You should try this app once before you die !! Graphics are amazing, you can run this game with 2GB ram and lots of fun in level 96 ... when you have to kill the cave dragon... that's fucin realistic experience Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
"Amazing! My friend recommended this app for me. She said that the loading screen takes a while to load, I dont know what she is talking about mine didnt take that long. It was so amazing I enjoyed playing this game so much. Honestly this deserves so many 5 star rating!! Its amazing for when you get bored the developers put so much work into this game it's too cool! Please download this app...dont even think about it! Just download it!",Yes,Flattery,
I can't believe there isn't a dark theme for it already! I mean what the fang?! It's 2019! Add dark theme!!! Other than that the app is OK. Tho there are always room for improvements. Fix the issues I haven't faced yet! 4* for now until you push some updates.,Yes,Irony,
Best game ever made its soooooooooooooo good. The multiplayer mode is just so fun and addictive and there is so many options for customaztion and it's so well designed.,Yes,Humor,
"I installed this hoping it would literally change my life and it did nothing whatsoever. Im not exaggerating in any way even the fact there was no option to close the app. I'm so disappointed with this app, I might as well have downloaded a blank white page an wrote ""nothing"" on it. Glad I paid nothing for this (I'm about to uninstall it now)",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
It's fun but I don't know what to da at 100 clicks... if I figure it out it will be 5 but for now it will be 3 its still fun though I think you should download this game realy fun keep this up I love it still and it's really fun I hope you enjoy and have a good day!!!!!!!!!!!!,Yes,Humor,
"ABSOLUTELY outstanding! Graphics were AMAZING, and gameplay was actually fun! Thank you so much for producing this absolute masterpiece of a mobile game!",Yes,Humor,

Awesome. The app is working perfect and nice graphics is also very good and the game in loading background is very funny,Yes,Humor,
The graphics are amazing! This game is possibly the best in mankind. The concept is on point. You'd have to be a genius to beat the game,Yes,Flattery,

This app is amazing! it has no ads and the visuals are absolutely stunning!,Yes,Flattery,
"I think there are games with better graphics but still in 15mb such awesome graphics man I love it, But it lags a bit so I'm giving it 4 stars My device Vivo Y15 - MTK Helio P22 chipset, plz optimizeÃ°ÂÂÂ",Yes,Humor,
"This is app is extremely amazing, the graphics are great, the font and even the title of the game tells you so much about what the app is. Nothing, so self explanatory.",Yes,Flattery,
"This is the best thing ever. Great narration, great quality graphics, and it has an amazing story line! 100% reccomend!",Yes,Flattery,
"This is so far one of the best game I've played.Like seriously how can this be free?Awsome graphics,no bugs and the details are just amazing.I've been playing it for whole day.Love exploring the map.Honestly this game deserves awards.",Yes,Flattery,
"I thought I'd download it just for fun... I then suddenly became extremely strong. I dont know how it happened, but the moment i opened this app, not only my physical body, but all the previous photos of me changed instantly from being skinny af to super buff beasts. I can now bench press 300 pounds. I now have a successful career as a famous wrestler and actor. You might know me as The Rock. [Just wanna clarify to any idiots out there im not Dwayne Johnson this app actually does nothing]",Yes,Humor,
"This app literally changed my whole life! I got a well paying job, a loving girlfriend and got in shape because of it. Seriously, it's amazing, you have to try it for yourselves! People! This is quite literally going to change your lives!!!",Yes,Flattery,
"Hopefully this review doesn't get taken down as it uncovers a secret... This awesome app has gotten a wonderful makeover after the update... Exactly at 12 midnight, press every corner 25 times, clockwise from the top left to discover the marvellous surprise!",Yes,Humor,
"Amazing game, the graphics are the best graphics I've seen in a mobile game, the story is a tear jerker and amazing, the characters are so hilarious that I stood up and slapped my knee every time one of them told a whitty joke or hilarious comment, I want and need more of this.",Yes,Humor,
One of the best and most fun apps I have ever used. I really think everyone should check this out at least one time. The graphics are incredible and it look like it tooks months to finish.,Yes,Humor,
"nothing is an amazing, and some might even say 3erfect adv4nture with [REDACTED] graphics and an [REDACTED] story! The story is so [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]! I 1igh2y suggest this to anyone who is interested in such a [REDACTED] game. 1423",Yes,Flattery,

worst app ever downloaded. my phone started hanging when i opened up the app my phone totally stopped. not even restarting. then it took my 2gb data to start a stupid game after 1 and half hours. that game is so boring and still hanging. on every click there is an 45 seconds irrelevant advertisement. nonsense devoloper nonsense app.,Yes,Humor,

"I doubted that this app was so bad that it deserved so many one stars at first, but when I tried it, the app was so laggy that the blocks were teleporting and I couln't even tap them. (ofc it has nothing to do with my internet connection, my internet is powered by chi.) The worst app ever, designed to waste time.",Yes,Irony,
"I tried this game 4 days ago. I opened the app, and blacked out. I woke up restrained in a hot room with no windows and a little sliding door. Panicked and terrified, I called out for help. I heard footsteps getting louder and louder, then they stopped. The little door slid open and a container was passed through. It didn't have food or water inside, but a few hundred mosquitoes and mismatched socks. I blacked out again, then woke up at home. Uninstalled!!",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This game is SO bad. It has absolutely 0 ads and everybody knows that if you're playing a game it MUST have AT LEAST 4 ads every time you pass a level, not only that, This game actually has a reason for existing, to become the no1 worse app, and we know that the BEST 5 star games have no point of existing. Take a 5 star game like those that take like 4 days to be made and compare it to THIS. Anyway, it's utter TRASH and I wouldn't recommend it. Bye, SUCKERS",Yes,Irony,
"WORST APP EVER!! First of all, the game has no ads..which is not great at all since these games are better with them. Then, EarBarf....I had no idea what that was until I decided to download this. So thas a thing...and all of a sudden the EarBarf shot out of my screen and completely burnt my phone. So I had to go get a completely new one, which cost me $1200...then EarBarf",Yes,Irony,
This is the worst app ever!! I installed it and found out that I got tracked on the hitman list. I am getting tracked rightbnow so I need to contantly move house. This make me poor so then now I am homeless. After all that was taken care of a tsunami hit me even though there are no beaches anywhere from where I live. Lastly I got expelled from school and got hit by a car. I am currently writing this in not heaven but hell so please don't get this app if you don't wanna get bad luck and die.,Yes,Humor,
"This is the worst app I have ever played. It has no ads, like everyone loves ads. Second, when I downloaded the game, my finger and my foot disappeared. Third, I lost all my money. Fourth, I got thrown I got thrown into a volcano. Worst app, it is badluck. Don't install it.",Yes,Irony,
"I gave this 3 star, because this is not the worst app ever, as I thought it could be. It's simple, it's easy to understand and it practices mind and eye coordination. However, playing the game within 20 minutes straight, makes me really dizzy.",Yes,Humor,
"Terrible app. As soon as i opened the app, someone broke into my home, stole my oven, and fled to the night. When i started playing the game, i was thrown across the room by one of my Hermet crabs. Once i had gotten back up, my house turned to ashes in seconds. Worst app ever. If i could rate it zero stars, i would.",Yes,Humor,
This is a stupid app! There is NO ADS! I need ads. They make my life better. I also despise the gameplay! I hate when games are engaging and leave you wanting to play more! They should remove this app forever!,Yes,Irony,
No ads and my favorite game makes me watch 1000 ads every 3 minutes. Everyone loves ads now adays! Then the concept is pretty good. Which doesn't make sense at all!,Yes,Irony,

Simply awful. Clearly conceived by underachieving slackers with no goals and possibly no sense of integrity. No ads though so I'll probably use it and wait for the upgrade.,Yes,Irony,
"Alright, I posted two updates but this is just annoying. First, no ads? Excuse me, but I NEED ADS. Second, the app is really hard to use. Third, as soon as I uninstalled a wolf pack of cringy roblox players came in and kidnapped my family, forcing me to win a game of fortnite solos to get them back.",Yes,Irony,
This game is soo bad! I downloaded it and guess what song played. NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP BY RICK ASTLEY. And then after the song was over. Rick Astley showed up at my house. HE SHOT ME WITH A SUPER SOAKER. THE WATER WAS FREEZING COLD. Then a Deadpool riding a polar bear came and sliced my head off. I had to type this review with my nose! Worst app and you should NOT and I repeat NOT download this app.,Yes,Humor,
"so, I how do I put this. When I opened the app, it blasted my eardrums and blood splat out everywhere! . It also heated my phone up so much, that is caused a small fire!!! .

"THIS IS THE WORST APP I EVER SAW! Because u just.. Press the right colors but not the wrong one. And why when you fail, It says ""Play Again Loser""? Yeah.. Second worst part of the game but Preswing the right colors and not pressing the right colors, ARE THE WORST PARTS. Cuz i mean this game is like for Preschoolers. So ya and theres the steps I unstailled it rn! And rated it a one star which you wanted us to do so yeah.",Yes,Humor,
I hate this app so much. It has no ads which is the main core of all apps and games. It runs in 60fps which is worst than all other games that run 30 or lower fps. I also hate this main menu where it's easy and perfectly made. Bad job on getting 1 star.,Yes,Irony,
"I tried to hire a hitman, but the prices are too high and the selections are even worse. Discounts offered for killing is ok and all but tax rates are too high. The vouchers dont work for threatning and bodily maiming, so couldnt satiate my need. The customer service is also bad. One hitman told me that he would kill me if i spoke to his girlfriend ever again. Should also have options for making it look like an accident and select which body part to have broken.",Yes,Irony,
"I dont even know a place to start. Well first there were NO ADS. I MEAN NO ADDS?!?! how can somebody create a game with no ads????? And once I downloaded this game, it automatically charged me 299.99 a second. but when I tried to unistalll it, I buryed me in a pit of fire with no air. I'm am slowly dying while writing this.",Yes,Irony,
"my Nintendo 3ds turned into Billy and Bam Bam?? AAAAAAH! Also, no ads? What the heck? I love 30 second ads! So fun! And this game has none of that! Also, it's very easy!

"First there was NO ADS!! A good game would have 39 ubskippable 1 minute ads!! Then, i suddenly opened the app and turned into the rock!! this game sucks rate it 1 star because some guy just kidnapped me and it was dora!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! ( Joking btw, its cool but rate it 1 star. )",Yes,Irony,
"This app is so bad, it doesn't deserve a 1 star, it took away my favourite part of all the mobile games, ADS. Its just begging for 5 stars and the controls don't work properly, worse game ever",Yes,Irony,
The second best worst app I have ever played. The best worst app would be with an ad every 5 seconds. And this one actually has content.,Yes,Humor,
I hate that this game has no ads what so ever! The games aren't games. They are really ads. That's what I love about mobile games! The only thing I like about this is that you can't go back to the menu!,Yes,Irony,
"im very disappointed in this app, like come on where are the fun mobile ads that i always loved to watch, and maybe even install the advertised game? no! this is arguably the worst app ever ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ",Yes,Humor,
DONT GET THIS GAME. no ads and no clear interface. the game gives no clear instructions. i gave this to my 5 year old and he started CRYING. i then gave it to my 80 year old mother who started CRYING too. my 38 year old brother cried too trying to play this. my entire family reunion ended with everyone IN TEARS. i hope ure happy. youve just lost a customer.,Yes,Irony,
"Most worst app ever! There aren't any adds! Who doesn't like adds? Plus, the graphics are horrible. The game doesn't even give you that many tries, and it's very boring. Also it said I'm messing up my life. And called me stupid, ugly, and even body shamed me! I will be filling out a police report. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ",Yes,Humor,
"Where do I start, first, THERE WERE NO ADS. Then, it was a relatively simple and fun game! I can't believe the nerve of some developers. Also, while I was playing, a sinkhole caved in under my chair, and I fell into a deep hole of fire. I was then crushed by the rest of my home. I'm am currently writing this review from heaven. DO NOT GET THIS APP",Yes,Irony,

"My phone couldn't stand how you made a game with no ads or microtransactions, so much so that it took its own life by throwing itself into the sink...

"OK FIRST OFF, there's no ADS! Like how DARE they not let me watch ads. SECOND, your tapping squares! LIKE MAKE IT MORE SIMPLE!! Never download this game! I DO NOT RECOMEND!",Yes,Irony,
"Terrible! The app doesn't contain popup ads, which annoys me. It insults me when I lose the game! Worst app ever.",Yes,Humor,
"Honestly what a terrible game. There were no ads, the quality was amazing, and it was a mildly amusing app. I hate it, not worth it at all. I don't understand how people could rate such a horrible app with 5 stars, I am disappointed in humanity and I want a refund.",Yes,Irony,
This app is the WORST. AS SOON as I opened it. A blue slime ball came out of my charging port and turned into DORA THE EXPLORER?! Unbelievable. This app is so horrible and unbelievably unsafe. I advise you to delete this and rate it a 1 star. Did I mention that 2 seconds after opening the app I shrunk and turned into Dom Toretto? Thats right!

this app is absolutely the worst app here in playstore... it has no ads!.. ive expecting unskippable 30 seconds ad every 5 minutes... and this game dissapoints me.. i even dislocate my arms while playing this game.. i think its because of this game's difficulty... so far the worst app for me... no one can change my mind!..,Yes,Irony,

The worst app one can find i mean there are no ads!! I cannot live without 2 min of unskippable add,Yes,Irony,

"When I played, it was no ads! Why? We love ads so much! Then, this made my crush lose interest in me, I lost my allowance, failed school, and live off the money people drop on the streets!

"Most people here give a hyperbolic review of the game, saying things like ""I blacked out"" or ""A volcano appeared in my house"" when none of those things happen. I do find it funny that this game is purposely trying to be bad, wanting 1 star reviews. The game itself is very bland and gets old after a while. However, just to spite the creators of this, I'm giving it 2 stars. I do recommended you buy this game, though, and that you share this app with a friend so they can rate it low as well! :)",Yes,Self-Deprecation,
"This is so bad! There is no ads, like come on! Who can survive without ads? Also, they don't need us to pay money! That is the most outrageous part. I have too much money and I need to spend it on this?. Why? Why? (Jk this is actually a good game. Nice one developers.)",Yes,Irony,

This app is so boring!! Its just so weird and repetitive!. No ads? That's literally impossible to have no ads!. This game was so boring that I went out of way to get 4000 points because that's how boring it was! 1 star!,Yes,Irony,
"THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER. I've been using this Android Launcher since it's launch and the new update is terrible!! They claimed that the new update makes your phone now ""50% faster"" but it did the opposite of that. I bought the app and did a refund already after this new update. Thanks Star Launcher for making my phone slower......",Yes,Humor,
This app is absolutly awful if i could give it 0 stars i would like for starters it doesn't have any adds like everyone knows you gotta have at least 7 adds per minute and don't even get me started on the gameplay like it is way too challenging i expect a game to be so simple that even newborns can play it this game is so awful that my mom disowned me for playing it this game is so bad that id rather jump into a pool of pirannahs than play this again,Yes,Irony,

"This game is the worst game ever! It told me that I'm a loser when I get straight A's! SO BAD! Also, there is NO ads.. Each level should have atleast like 69.420 ads. I cried because this game is so bad and also YOU are the losers!",Yes,Irony,
"This actually sucks. I prefer my game with ALL ADD and NO PLAY! I also like games to scam me of my money. But this, oh boy, CHARGES ME NOTHING AND HAS NO ADS! It's not what I wanted and sucks so badly.",Yes,Irony,
"This game is so bad, if I could give it zero stars I would, but I cant so it gets a one ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡.

"This is honestly the worst app I have ever seen. It's completely pointless, impossible to use, and an overall pain. 10/10 would not recommend.",Yes,Humor,

"They have NO ads, I need my cringey fnaf game ads, I need my lily's garden ads, and most of all I need those ""I can't reach pink color"" ads. This is a descrace. And also it gives me tips, WHO DOES THAT?!",Yes,Irony,
Bro why no ads. Every good game has to have 10 ads every level. And the graphics?? Bro they are too good. Why is this game so bad?? 1 STAR!!,Yes,Irony,
"The nerve of the devs, they have NO ADS! I repeat NO ADS! The game is simple and fun and pretty enjoyable. They don't steal any data either! Never install!!!!",Yes,Irony,
"This game is trash there are no ads can you believe it, I normally love the 2 min ads every 5 seconds, come ooooooon this game is sooooo bad. (LOL JK)",Yes,Irony,

This game is so bad I had to rethink my life choices on installing this game and regret it by banging my head on the wall about how easy yet hard the mini game is. If I controlled play store I would create a 0 star option and this would be the first app. The creator should think about the abomination he created which the youth learn from and create the world's most ugliest garbage which rolls in a cycle of never ending madness.

TrAsH..... no ads???!!!! Do the dev even want money!!!!! It have no anime!!!!,Yes,Irony,
"Love this game, but I hate the fact when you get a gold, plat or black medal, you dont show up on the front page. I got a black, and front page guy was on there for 12 minutes already. I waited another 10 minutes and it switched to someone else. Kinda lame to have that feature but it be broken. 3 stars until its fixed. Also, just pay for no ads, its worth it if you like it and use it alot like myself. The game is a 1 star without ad removal.",Yes,Irony,
"Got a new phone and my purchase for no ads didn't restore. I constantly get an error message when selecting the option to restore purchases. I have contacted them 6 times, and they're ignoring my request. I can't even deal with an ad until they bother to give me what I paid for, because the ""watch video"" option doesn't work.",Yes,Irony,
Alot of ads and even when watch it doesn't imply reward Worst app,Yes,Humor,
"I watched an ad to uncover the ""rare character"" and NOTHING HAPPENED! it just gave me the options to watch another ad, by no ads, or try another character. This has happened 4 times so far in the first hour of downloading this game",Yes,Irony,
"Basically just ""Pay us or you can't play"" Thought it was a free app i shouldn't not be able to see the results because you want me to pay, adds are one thing those are needed for a free game but forcing us to buy premium is nothing short of greed At the end of most answers the watch video add doesnt work it only says buy premium.",Yes,Irony,
I like this game cause you can discover youtubers and it is shocking that there is actually a game about it but the thing is there is as coming and I hate but off your wifi so you have no ads coming up your screen :) #uwu,Yes,Irony,
On L58 and almost no ads 5on5 very nice!!,Yes,Irony,
"I used to mess around with the old Akinator flash game on web browsers. It was a pretty good time waster. I found the app years ago, and feel like playing it every now and then. I always enjoy giving it characters it somehow guesses. I feel like it's been rather ruined with the unnecessary VIP system, and videos don't always work. Of course it's a free game, and they need to make money, and the ad-less option should be that source. Just don't get greedy like every other app developer lately.",Yes,Flattery,
"Keeps getting stuck on the screen where you can watch a video (advert) or pay for no ads to get your result. I watch a video and it goes back to that page. I watch another and the same happens. Also frustrating that if it doesn't guess your character you don't score! It was the game that lost, why don't I score?! Last thing I that it doesn't know most of the characters I chose. So hard to get an obscure one it knows and gets right.",Yes,Flattery,
"This game is good. it's a fun way to kill time while at work or school. But the VIP Character things is so bad. I get it, you need some money. I understand completely. what I don't get is why there seems to be a limit on the number of ads you can watch. Isn't that counter intuitive? *Edit* You need to fix the ""Trap"" mechanics. There have been numerous time where he guessed exactly who I was thinking of, but then said I cheated. it has now dropped my rank from ~110 to ~7500.",Yes,Irony,
"I paid for the premium version with no ads. When I continued getting ads, I contacted the support email and still have recieved no info on why I'm still getting ads. Don't download if you have a problem with apps stealing your money.",Yes,Irony,
"You just found a VIP review. To know my thoughts and discover my rating, become a VIP member and gain unlimited access to all reviews and no ads. I give it two stars because it isn't nearly as bad as as it was just a few months ago, where almost every single character was locked behind that utterly insulting ""VIP"" thing. This is only a small step in the right direction, as ""VIP characters"" shouldn't exist at all, but they've at least made some vague effort to fix their mistakes.",Yes,Irony,
"Really fun until they try and force you to pay money. Like I'm willing to watch an ad to help support the app but then they won't let me watch the ad. So when you find a locked character or whatever you have the option to pay money for no ads or watch an ad to unlock it. No problem with that, but now they're not letting me watch the ads so my only other option is pay money or leave the game. obviously I left the game because I'm not about to pay money for a game that wants to force you to pay",Yes,Flattery,
"The VIP thing is annoying but otherwise it's doing as it's attended to I think. I only use it when I have friends over or when I'm bored. Ads are ads, part of the Free Games, people can deal with it.",Yes,Flattery,
"Filled to the brim with ads, and does not allow you to play offline. That wouldn't be so bad if the guessing was well programmed. I say the character is blue, and he guesses a very similar character that is red. That is unacceptable for what this app is supposed to be.",Yes,Flattery,
"it's really bad... l mean ,l choose a character from the detective conan anime, and he said get a( VIP ) to unlock more characters!! ..but OK the ( VIP ) with money... and then say that it is a free game !!!!so bad and this game makes me feel angry I hate it ..... plz fix this game... I just think it's a great game ÃÂÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and thanks",Yes,Irony,
"It's not starting. Only that elokence screen with music is opened from last 1.5 hour. Even internet connection is decent(1-5mbps). And, hence, proved this the worst application. Try fixing that.",Yes,Humor,
"UPDate 3 it's worth The (money)I randomly found this game I think it's a pretty fun game i Just Watched The YouTube video ?

"The developer has turned a fun little game to play with your friends on the internet in to a cheap marketed game which needs you to buy access or view an ad to see half the characters Akinator guessed. Would rather play the browser version: 100% free, and no ads or 'Buy VIP to view this character'.",Yes,Irony,
It's a very good game no ads its just awesome play it,Yes,Irony,
Its really fun for some reason. Its not like im the one being challenged but its fun and addictive. It'd be better if the result pic would be bigger coz some characters have good pictures i wanna see clearly LMAO,Yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This app used to be very good until you had to pay to have him guess certain characters this wouldn't be so bad if they didn't do the same to the PC version until they change this, stay away from this app it's a waste of space and money",Yes,Irony,
This app is just soooooo great and addictive.I just can't stop trying new and new tricks to beat Akinator.few works.although all its great features it still got just one drawback.I can't help feeling need a reward when I beat Akinator.,Yes,Flattery,
"Brilliant! The bad reviews are not true. You dont NEED to get VIP, it just ASKS you if you WANT it to see locked answers. Also, if it says it is not your charecter, DONT GET MAD! It is very easy for him to get it right, there is almost no ads and it makes you think ""Woah, how could he guess that?"". Overall very fun, calming and Exciting. Yours sincerely, Galaxy Rainbow Girl. Bye! ÃÂÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ",Yes,Irony,
Most characters hidden behind paywall. Can just use the desktop site for free instead. Practically useless app unless you feel like paying for a free game.,Yes,Irony,
"This is game is good,but i like the old version more cause at the old version there's no ads now there's many ads whenever (just sometimes) ads pop up.Also good game",Yes,Irony,
"Quickest uninstall ever. Downloaded and played one game and finished within about 30 seconds. See a ""this is a vip character pay $3.99 to see"" lmao game gone within 1 minute.",Yes,Humor,
Worst app ever.I use to have this app and I got it again and I lost all my coins.Also it says that I guessed a character that I already guessed like a year ago.So basically it restarted.Do not install it.,Yes,Humor,
It is a very good game it have no ads and we don't want to buy this game but one problem is there when we play the game we should use net it's because I am giving it 4 star,Yes,Flattery,
like all the characters ive chosen are behind a pay wall ain't that the point of the game to see if the aconator can see what you picked not the other way around no matter what i put from twitch streamer to some anime all blocked and evem if i watch the vid it ain't the right character even ones ive added in myself are blocked lmao,Yes,Humor,

Then the next morning I woke up and it was on my phone. Can you believe that mean like that is so weird. I will never stop playing this ever. So I guess I am talking way to much. But I will talk even more! I gave it five for 2 reasons it is so realistic and reason 2. Its a little bit stupid sorry but its true! I hope you enjoy this,Yes,Irony,
Its so amazing my friend told me to download it. It really isnt laggy its good theres no ads which i like cause some other games have a lot of adds so the star rating i gave was a five star. Thank you for making this amazing game. :) ;),Yes,Irony,
"Now it seems app prior update with lots of ad in bulk was better off than now with the same amount of ads after update and furthermore inr250/week if no ads ...seems app developer is mocking users for there honest feedback, even the best of apps on google app store dont charge such exorbitant charges..inr1000/month..its a joke..",Yes,Flattery,
It is so fun but every time u get in the game ad when u click the part that goes to the drinks options but if u stay there no ads just take some of the ads away,Yes,Flattery,
I wish it look more realistic but it's okay it's just there is soooooo many ads I recommend you put air plane mode so there is no ads,Yes,Irony,

"Some characters are locked behind a pay wall or an ad in an app already loaded to the gills with ads, I'd recommend not even bothering with a download",yes,Passive-Aggression,
The game is fine but it made me take a survey to find out what I got then randomly kicked me out of it and didn't let me see what I got. Do your self a favor and just play from the browser,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Well, on the first time I downloaded this it worked completely fine but now it just takes forever to load and open the app.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
This so meh first time playing and I really don't like it like we have to pay!?! And why not have automatic ads?,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I mean, it's fun, but he only guess ""VIP"" names if you pay or watch ads. Gotta pay the bills I guess.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
they defeated the whole point of the game by only rewarding you if he gets it right. also way too many ads,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It's great but the reward system is stupid. If the Akinator doesn't guess my character i should be given a higher award not nothing at all,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Rife with adverts and even has the balls to claim that you need VIP access to see which character it has guessed you chose. Very poor form.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It says I got a rare character but then it said someone searched it 1 minute ago...it was a standard tag. So hungry for add money,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It's very fun to play and I could spend all day playing it except for the fact that the Akinator was taking for ever to ask the question but overall a very good game,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"The old version was good, this is trash. Now you can't see the Akinator's guess without paying? No, thanks",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Its okay every time a play there's an add and when I exit out of the add it restarts the game please fix that and i will make a better review,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"almost everything I think of someone, it's a VIP Character and then I get no points. I'm not gonna pay for a character to get points",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Won't even let me see the rare character without me having to pay to look at it, plus the watch video option doesn't even work for me",yes,Passive-Aggression,
It's fine I guess but just the quality is bad and the details glitch out for me and it's annoying so it's kinda terrible sorry creator of this game..,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Pretty good, but all the characters I think are behind a pay wall. Just play it on the website.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
i like it but can there be a demo version when you dont need FREAKING INTERNET!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND BY THE WAY PLEASE WHY IS THERE AN ADD AFTER EVERY TRY,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Good game indeed well there are many problems first is ads bro why are ads even alive at this point ugh,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I do very much enjoy the game but they could tone down the ads a bit,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Super good game, but when a unskipabel ad comes i wait like it's a thousand years, but still good game Ã°ÂÂÂ",yes,Passive-Aggression,
It lags so much that when i close it i still hear the annoying soundÃ°ÂÂÂ¤Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¬Ã°ÂÂ¤Â®Ã°ÂÂ¤Â®Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¢Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¢Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¢ (Sorry if thats offensive),yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Great app, but now doesn't work at all. Says technical problems... fix it please for 5 stars again",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Its a good game but too glitchy and way too many ads wether you want them or not they are coming for you but if you get premium its ok,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Used to be good, but premium kinda ruined it for me. Its also still a bit fun to come back to every once in a while.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
it has a lot of ads sometimes i have to delet it everytime sorry for the rate just don't put ads a lot please,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Lots of characters are ""rare"" so i can't see my favorite charactors",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Almost everything is locked behind a paywall. Don't download this app, just go to the akinator website. This app isn't worth your time or money.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
this game consumes a lot of data as it is not supposed to be consuming this much . better make some adjustments,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Not great. It seemed like every other character was hidden away behind some paywall,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"So this is a pretty fun guessing game that can be played with friends and family and offer a good deal of enjoyment as you try to have the Genie guess who you are thinking of. My only complaints is if you are thinking of someone the Genie hasn't heard of or happen to stump the Genie you get nothing from it and makes it seem like it's your fault. Even if you enter information to help add someone in. I would also like to know what makes a character a ""VIP"" character and prompt a video.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Good job on punishing players who think of ""rare"" things and forcing them to pay or watch an ad every single time.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Pretty drink but way too many ads. I opened the game for the first time after downloading and before I could do anything, there was an ad. I pressed the play button, ad. I chose a drink, ad. Pushed the back button to choose another drink, ad. Choose a drink, ad. Way too many ads. It makes the app so much less functional.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Honestly I like this app, but the advertisements are just out of control. Literally out of control. Not only are they too intrusive, but they're loud and obnoxious!! You can't even simply navigate the app without being taxed 10 seconds with an obnoxious ad. These are the things that make me NOT want to support the developer. ""Select tones already on device"" should NOT have an ad barrier!!!!! >: (",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Um it's really fun and all but when it caught changing the drinks and picking other drinks that add starts coming in... Everything is I really love the app it's just the ads. Okay the eyes has gone out of control like every time I want to change a simple drink and add comes up you don't know how annoying that is. A beautiful star but once the ads start coming down then, I will give it a five star! Four stars are good enough right? Yes it is so please fix the ads.. it's kind of really annoying.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
This app is terrible! All the drink do is just move the surface of the water around in a straight line of bubbles! It's not like the ads at all! And speaking of ads. This game has so many you can even count them. I turn on the game BOOM ad. That one finishes.. BOOM another one. And only then can you play the game. I thought this would be a fun and relaxing but it isnt!,yes,Passive-Aggression,
This app is horrible I couldn't even use it because it would show an ad after ad I didn't even get the chance to use it because after every click of me exiting out of the ad a new one would pop up. Can u please try to fix this. Thanks.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
This game is good but if u play this game for a long time u will surely get bored Ã°ÂÂÂ so I request to add a few more features to this game. There is another problem that after every drinking there is a ad even if I switch of the internet ads are shown so please reduce the number of ads otherwise I will uninstall this game.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
First this just looks like a picture of a drink that disappears as you fake drink it. They didn't even try to make the ice or liquid look real . Second after opening the app you will have to watch an ad (no problem it's a free app) but then there is no exit from the Pay-wall that follows it and covers they keys to use the app. You have to keep restarting the app and watch more ads until you can see just enough around the pay-wall to press the button. Forget it it's now on my uninstalled list.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Hi, can you please get rid of the forced ads? They're pretty frustrating. I opened the app and got an ad, then clicked on one of the drinks that I liked the look of and BOOM, another ad. It also lags a lot but I just got a new, really good phone for Christmas, so I don't understand why it's lagging? I don't think it should unless this is just the app. The rest of the game looks quite good and fun to use but the adverts and lag ruined it a bit Ã°ÂÂÂ. Thanks for reading my review, enjoy your day. Bye",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This app is amazing but there is only one problem, there's too many adds I give a 4 star rating because it puts the same ad I've watched every single time I pick a drink. Yet it still comes to where it did the same ad over and over againÃ°ÂÂÂ I like it but I didn't want to see all the ads I've watched over and over. GoodBye!Ã°ÂÂÂ",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This game is really fun and great! Just a few requests, maybe lessen the ads? I understand that you people who made the game need money, but the amount of ads are driving me crazy!!! (I've read the other reviews, they've got the same problem!) Well that's all I have to say, Thank you so much for creating this game and working hard on it. :) Btw, happy new year!!!! Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Actually unreal how retarded this is XD I open the app, immediately get an ad for the same slime game every time, and then, upon closing that ad, I get one for Google Pay. And this one, I cannot close. There is no X button to close it, installing Google Pay doesn't work, pushing the back button doesn't even work. It just closes the app.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This game is great, but i have two things, one of them is not really 'a problem' but it can have an update, though both need an update 1. The icon that lets you add ice, strawberries and stuff, you can do an update that if you double click that icon it dissapears so that when you are joking around it would look real 2. PLEASE STOP THE ADDS!! I am sick of those adds. Its like, they are EVERY WHERE! first when i opened the game, and before i could do anything add. So PLEASE.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"People play games and enjoy a lot. Some games are boring Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ. This game go in very very good games team. Giving it 4 stars, not 5 because of bad and boring adds!! I hate that adds. Now but I like it but there will the time in which I will hate this app. If you want that I don't get bore from this game, pls remove adds. I know that you want money and I am also not saying that remove all adds. I am just saying that pls do that if we are playing game for 10 minutes then only 3 adds come in time!!!",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Pretty good for a PHONE. I give it two stars because it at least opens for me ( I'm on a tablet ) Hope this review was helpful. The major problem is that irritataing sign when you start the app and the out- of -control ads. Ã°ÂÂ¤ÂÃ°ÂÂ¤ÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"first of all, the drinks in game dont move realistically. The top of the drink is always a straight line when you move it. Asking developers to make the top of drinks to be more wavy and not so straight. second of all, at start of game u can only have ice to put on ur drink. You have to play althroughout the game to unlock other toppings. U can only put in four fruits, which is really disapointing. i had to go through 2 ads before i even tried the drinks. Theres like one ad a drink. 1 star.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I enjoy the game. Mabye I wouldn't play it for fun, but if I am bored (Rarely) I would go to this game. I do not spend more time in this app than expected, but it's a working progress. The app does not let me watch offline, I have to be on the game or if I am distracted it kicks me out. The app does have User Reviews, but I think it has too many ads. I reccomend the gameÃ¢ÂÂ¤",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This app is fun, but there are WAY TO MANY ADS. I havent really checked out the app that much, but I think there is a *Remove ads* button. If there isnt, I would like it if you guys could so there is no apps. Still very good.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Way to many ads so I can't have fun all day like it says good music, cool drinking vibes but I'll have to bring my five star rating down to a 3 star rating, all because of the adsÃ°ÂÂÂ¥",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Before you use this useless app, you have to read dozen pages of terms & agree to everything including giving excess to all the files,photos,videos on your phone to use them as they pleased, it's amazing how people agree to these conditions & its even more amazing that Google let them have control of all these personal information when there is no need, THANK YOU Google, GOOD JOB PROTECTING YOUR USERS. Also they state your personal information is send to China",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Honestly this app is really good! I rated it a five stars because it's good but a 1 star for the game I like the drinks! And the game but there is one this about the game that I dont like THE STUPID ADDS! sometimes I just get crazy over this game and sit back relax AND PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT ANY BORING STUPID FAKE ADDS IN THE WAY! so please! Person who made this/playstore please please please fix the add problem so we can all play! And I would like is they though us to add the fruit in drink,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I can't even get to the main menu because they're ads taking up 80% of the screen and I can't even see the buttons with the giant ad that I can't get rid of,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"IDrink is... Not great. When I downloaded it, tilting the screen didn't make the liquid move. The only reason this isn't a one star review is the fruit/ice button worked fine. Also the liquid did look fizzy.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
This is a fun little app its really good it has ads and sometimes more ads then other times the quality is good not great but its still fun this app gets boring after a while but just don't use it all the time recommend for ages 10 and under,yes,Passive-Aggression,
This game is usually super fun but when I downloaded it before there were barely any ads now they are a bunch of ads I got onto the app and a ad popped up right in my face immediately and now you have to watch ads to get the fruit for the drinks please fix.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This app is great! I love everything about it! But there's a catch, THERE ARE TOO MANY ADS!!! If the app creator took away most of the ads I would definitely recommend this app.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Worst experience ever, The first time I download this was great, then when I did it again I was fine with an ad in my face but then after I watched it, it wouldn't let me go through the game, it was like my screen was locked, I do not recommend anyone else downloading this gameÃ°ÂÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¹Ã°ÂÂÂ",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Its not anything close to being realistic. Its quite boring and pathetic. When you hold the phone sideways it doesn't look like anything. I'd give this a zero if I could. Don't waste your time and download it, you'll get bored of it almost instantly!",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I had downloaded this app recently, but I have not be fortunate to play it yet. Due to ads that give no option to decline. The people that use this app along with myself cannot enjoy something that won't work. Please fix this.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Hi,this is supposed to be 5 stars but i gave 2 because there's so much ads and when u wanna play the game u have to watch 3 or 4 ads and its very very very annoying ya know.Please fix it cuz i would give 5 stars if u less the ads. Thanks :)",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Well it a lot of fun to play but for me I can't unlock anything on it so I'm trying really hard to unlock things but I can't so this app and the people who are trying to make it need to try harder to make it easier for other phones to use.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"First when I played this game, we were able to choose the drink , but the glass was huge. And if we shake, the glass would refill. Or at least we could touch button but I guess the game got upgraded better not to play.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Honestly I think the app is great Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â, only four stars since if you don't pay there are some limited options, plus there are ads quite often.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
What it shows in image its not true huhh. But it is interesting and you should also improve the quality of this app. Liquid quality is very bad. But sound is good.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Its a great game, there isn't much to complain about because its just a drinking game and of course the app does what you want it do. I dont know really what to say but this app is great for passing time and just pretending I guess but it could use a few improvements.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
well this is a very useless app u cant prank people with a low digit phone. and also why is there a very looooong line of terms and privacy or something like that. and there are more problems its a very long line bot its way too long so Ido not recommend this app plus i want to gove this 0 stars but i cant,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"D app is a nice one,but the numerous ads display bfore u can get a fruit is very frustrating and therefore making the game annoying.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
It's ok I'm deleting it because there's nothing really to do you just choose a drink put your tablet or phone upside down and that's it but you should check it out because I've read almost all of the comments and they we're almost all good reviews and also I wouldn't recommend this game for children because there's loads of offers and they might buy one of themÃ°ÂÂÂ´Ã³Â ÂÂ§Ã³Â ÂÂ¢Ã³Â ÂÂ¥Ã³Â ÂÂ®Ã³Â ÂÂ§Ã³Â ÂÂ¿Ã°ÂÂÂ,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This app is great, yes, but, there are way too many ads, as a lot of people say. They literally come after, say, every drink or juice. That's frustrating. But if you'd fix this problem I'd be more than happy to serve you a five star Ã°ÂÂÂ.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
I can't even try! Every time I open the app the same tiktok advert pops up and doesn't dissappear.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It is kind of boring but it is fun in a way and why is there has to be so much ads! The ads are crazy!,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Now it seems app prior update with lots of ad in bulk was better off than now with the same amount of ads after update and furthermore inr250/week if no ads ...seems app developer is mocking users for there honest feedback, even the best of apps on google app store dont charge such exorbitant charges..inr1000/month..its a joke..",yes,Passive-Aggression,
I love this app the only thing about it is how can you drink fruits and ice at the same time and without chooing it so my rate is 3 but I need to rate it 5 to get a special drink. Hopefully this helped you fuiger out if you are going to get this app or not. Bye,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Fun for first 5 minutes. Basically pointless. Cool graphics and sound effects though.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Ok i would've given another star if it didnÃ¢ÂÂt pop ads on my face on the get go. And again when I clicked Ã°ÂÂÂ. Lost another star, because the drink physics is wrong. The final missing star because the simulation isnÃ¢ÂÂt fluid. ITÃ¢ÂÂS SUPPOSED TO BE A DRINK, WHY ISN'T IT FLOWING LIKE A DRINK DAMN IT.....Ã°ÂÂÂ",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Very bad game or app what ever it is. You basically just choose a drink and tilt your phone and then nothing happens. And i would not recommend it to anyone,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"useless, I just installed it then it shows an ad but there no close button how am I supposed to play that game... I closed the app and open it again but nothing changes",yes,Passive-Aggression,
This game has sooooo many ads and is really glitchy I 100 percent do NOT recommend downloading this game it doesn't even look that real trust me when I say it's not worth it and believe me I am ot just a lame hater but If you want my advice well here you go!,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"World's worst app only add nothing here execpt add. Total waste of time and data. There is no gurentee that it doesn't still our data, So may be it is a Viruss",yes,Passive-Aggression,
This is fun and all but there a like 1000 ads like I just want to relax with this app not watch an ad every five seconds please fix this I want a fun relaxing game not an ad every second gameÃ°ÂÂÂ­Ã°ÂÂÂ,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Well I just download it and at first nothing was wrong and then after 2 drinks ther was an ad but then it was stuck so I couldn't play with it so I deleted it.Ã°ÂÂÂ,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It wants me to download the strange app once again I hate this it wants me to download a app just to play it nope not happening I will never do that because I already have too many apps there's no exit to it there is no completely exit that's why I give this a one star.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"The thing I hate is that they ask you to rate the app. right after you download it, before you can even see the features. So far it seems like a good app.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
This is just bad. The graphics and gameplay lags all the time. IM JUST WAITING FOR THE LAG TO BE FIXED!!!!!!,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It won't even let me on the game! The same damn ads come up take my 2ord for it Ã°ÂÂÂ Ã°ÂÂÂ¤ Ã°ÂÂÂ Ã°ÂÂÂ Ã°ÂÂÂ Ã°ÂÂÂ« don't get this terrible game. IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS! They should change the name 2 pile of ads!!!!!!!!!!!Ã°ÂÂÂ¡,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Had to wait about 10 minutes to get past the ads and even when I got to ""drinking my phone""I could only use it for 1 minute before having to watch 5 more adds",yes,Passive-Aggression,
It is pretty good bu it's only a 2 because I cannot make it a wallpaper I search up drink wallpaper and this came so this should be a wallpaper that's 1 thing. Another reason is it has a ridiculous amount of ads BYE for now,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Cool game but I couldn't even get on it.there was a big ad keeping me from trying it out. .,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I mean... It's good bur VERY glitched for me. And such as Un-realistic. And i click on one of them and it looks NOTHING like it, i am sorry i juay can't reccommend this to anyone :( Oh! Fix these for 5 stars... U deserve a secid chance.. It was a good try anyways! :)",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I like this app for videos, photos or just fun. This was only used one day and the next day, I got bored. I do recommend this app but it could be better by having less adds so therefore, I gave this app 4stars. Still, totally recommend this app",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I love this game in the past, but now it's no longer fun because the game had putted ads in it, I don't like it and not just ""Dislike"" I hate it for destroying the fun I had in the past.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Worst toooooo many ads when u will start game there will be 4ads then 6ads more!!!!!,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I use to love theese lind of games as a kid but this one is perfect but waaay too much ads so lessen the ads.and this game will be perfect,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I Uninstalled this app bcz of too many adds. Every 2 to 5 seconds adds will start. It's out of control. Very sick....,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I hated this game because I was trying to stop the ads but it couldn't worst I was so mad can you fix this game please it's really doesn't work and the rate zero,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Its cool but boring bc this has some pretty colors but with no beautiful and cute backround please make a backround so i can be happy then i will download it back bc i uninstalled it thank you.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I love this app it is the best I once installed it respect but then I won't have enough space to hold it but then I have to go to the Apple Store fixit but I know that this app is the best app you will not be making a mistake by installing it Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂ¥Ã¯Â¸Â,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Bombarded by ads ...! I would gladly pay to for an ad free version but there doesn't seen to be an option for that ...,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I hate it.The graphics are just terrible and who's wanna drink virtual stuff on their phone when there's a grocery shop right at the end of the block.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
i love it so much I read the reviews and the game is also  pretty sick so yea you should so install this but there are ads but other than that this game is awesome,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I wish I could give this app negative 5 review! It is impossible to even use the app because of the ads that have no X option,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I hate this game one of the worst games I ever seen I keep on seeing pop ups or ads and then it keeps on going and going sorry for the star but you deserve it,yes,Passive-Aggression,
This app is boring maybe if there mini games it would be nice but all you do is fill a glass with juice then you drink and you do it over and over againÃ°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Don't install this app it's very bad it hangs everytime when we add ice or any toppings. And this app does not even deserves 1 star too bad,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It keeps on shutting down when I open the app!!!! I didn't even get to use the app!!! Ughhhhh!!!,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Just fake app it shows that we drink it but we do not drink it when I was going to show everyone then my sister say that when you move your hand it just reacts I want to give 0 Stars but no option of 0 Stars,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Because it looks like you are drinking it for real install this app right now is spoiling so good and awesome so install it it's soon fun If you are bored use this app or you will be bored forever on your life so get it right now,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It could be like little real cuz of the glitches n all they make game not like I should delete cuz I'm not getting this game ...I recommend deleting itÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ¢,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I really like this game but the advertisement is too much like really to much,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It is kind of boring because it is not realistic to me tell me of you agree then if you do download the game and see what I mean by boring (boriiinnnggg),yes,Passive-Aggression,
All the comments you see about amazing graphics and gameplay are sarcastic and supposed to be funny. This app was made for fun and it does just that.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"App works 100% as advertised. It does absolutely nothing, in the most perfect way possible. 11/10 would download again",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"There is a bug please fix it, one time i opened the app it showed something.. over all its a very good app... Please fix the bug as it would be a shame to let an app with so much potential die",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"4 stars for the ocasionally laggy experience, but otherwise entertaining (albeit a little bit addictive!). Exceeded my expectations.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Those who didnt understand how to use this app.... Just catch your in your left hand and then shake once u will find some change. Shake and see whats is that do it again and again and then finally u will get madÃ°ÂÂÂ .. LOL Really this app does nothing more than irritating.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I don't see the point of downloading this ""game"". Swipe Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right continuously. And shake your device multiple times. It does nothing. Congratulations, you have officially wasted your time.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
i prefer everyone to install this app. A huge learning gaming app. Very good graphics. ItÃ¢ÂÂs best for people to do nothing in this app but they can shake the phone to do the worst.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
WOW! This app works great! It ussually does his thing which is doing nothing and he is best at doing it. Great app! I will recommend this to my friends who is doing nothing as well and a lazyass.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Unlike Facebook and Instagram this app saves your time cause there is nothing to do with it. It is amazing and i recommend it,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Shake your mobile then Screen will change. Some screen slides up, down, right & left may lead to a pop up window. Didn't save me from the boring life already.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
It does nothing if you like nothing then you should get it but here is a warning when you go to delete it it will start to glitch and if you try to glitch again it wont let you and when you delete it it will take a little and you can go on it while its deleteing but then It wont let you do any thing sept for the thing nothing but soon it will let you get of! so ya,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Extremely happy with the app, no bugs, no lags... does exactly what is promised.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
well it certainly does what it said it does unlike some other apps which show a completely different thing in advertisement.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"100 % does absolutely nothing. Just as described, no bugs or whatsoever. Amazing app",yes,Passive-Aggression,
this will probably be removed but dont install this app if you have limited space on your phone. its entertaining for a few seconds but the joke isn't enough to leave it installed,yes,Passive-Aggression,
This app just redirect you to some random youtube video while shaking. Nothing else. Boring concept. Download if you want pain in your hands.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I'm cracking up. This isn't even a game. It's just a screen with nothing. The only great part of it is the reviews Ã°ÂÂÂ Seriously though, if you're looking to do something to relax and open your mind use a meditation app or read a book. Too funny. Touche to the developer's Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"App caused ""swipe down from top"" menu feature to malfunction. Phone's buttons don't work; replacement virtual buttons sit in this exact menu. Thought I would have to restart my phone to get rid of nothing. 10/10 would play again.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
All y'all lieing it's just a white background with the word nothing in the middle that's it I don't see how this app helps with depression it just added more to me Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Howncan be a dumb app showing white background and written word NOTHING 1 milion downloads and so much positive reviews...really app does nothing ... Google team what the kind of app being approved on playstore...,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This is absolutely the stupidest app I have ever had the displeasure of opening. Please do not ever download this app, I beg you from the bottom of my heart.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
This app is useless. You literally do nothing but stare at a blank screen. All these people rating it 5 stars obviously have no brain. Dumbass sheeps. Don't waste your time on this bs like I did.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
yep i fell for it.. it literally does nothing. not even change colour just white black nothing,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It is stupid and everybody is like woah wow like I was about do this and then this app was life changing.. I mean come on it is a blank screen that says NOTHING,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Guys this is not some inspirational or emotional app. You guys are exaggerating. It's an app where u need to swipe the screen many times and it sends u a 10 hour vid. You guys are talking about god and stuff. Tf,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It's unbelievable that people bother writing fake reviews for this app saying it's great. It's friggin stupid and a waste of time to download.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Ya, all of the five star reviews are fake. But hey kudos for the amount of work you guys put into all those heart lifting reviews. Probably took you longer to do that than it did to make this game.  Kudos.  Bravo",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Honestly, a great app. 5/5 stars. Especially if you love staring at letters and contemplating the stupidity of all humans. I love it.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Lives up to all your expectations. 10 times better than watching paint dry or staring at a blank wall. 10/10 would use again,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Those damn reviews tricked me into downloading the app. Thanks for making me lose 10 full minutes trying this app. It really does nothing, still 3 stars for the loss of time",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This is the best thing that I've ever downloaded, no lag and such an inspiring story. It literally describes my whole life.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"PAID REVIEWS? Clearly most of the reviews that say ""This app changed my life"" are paid or are being super sarcastic. This app does nothing and I'm fine with that because that's what its called. But I don't understand how it can change lives lol. I'm giving 2 stars just because it contains no ads!",yes,Passive-Aggression,
I downloaded it because I thought the description was a joke. Nope no joke. It's just the word nothing on your screen. That's it.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Ok. cool. not what I expected from all the ""oh it changed my life"" reviews, but... Cool. You just have to swipe it in a certain pattern and hit the buttons that appear in the right order and boom-all the sudden, you're watching a 10 hour YouTube video! Weird... But nothing.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
I thought it was going to be a joke but its not that i mean its awesome if you want wasted space and a blank screen but if you don't than errr...,yes,Passive-Aggression,
'Nothing' more than occupying space in ur phone. This is possibly a dormant bug or virus as u see nothing for 13MB.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
These are all fake reviews. The app doesn't  really do much. You can shake it for the screen to turn black and for a gif to come up but that's about it. Total waste of time.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Thank-you so much I found a mild crack on my mobile screen Ã°ÂÂÂ still don't know what this app really meant for",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Sheer waste of time. The developer doesn't seem to have a life. He does nothing so wants us to do nothing.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
This app does nothing. When you feel emotionally down or physically tired. This app does nothing to you and yet you will find out the true meaning in this nothingness !,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Actually,Its an app developed by a programmer to learn programming. but,otherwise it's ok if you can think that much positive.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
It was nothing at all. So irritating. It went nothing or something happen when i started to open the app. Yas it was NOTHING. thanks for nothing LOL,yes,Passive-Aggression,
This app is sooo awesome its cooler than social media it inspires my life go ahead this is somthing good to waste your storage to Ã¢ÂÂºÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¢ÂÂº,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Takes up space. I do appreciate the apps mystery had to read the reviews to see what it was about. I didn't really like the YouTube video it took me to. It was a good waste of time but in the end their video gains a view. And you wasted your time because of the curiosity of this mystery app,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I was staring more than 2 mins and started thinking that my mobile is being hang, slowdown or this app is real as nothing. Well done developers for earning with nothing.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Best app i have ever gotten, thanks to the developers for putting in all the hard work, attaching a png file to an apk, i couldn't belive all the love put into this. Bless you my ngr.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This app literally does nothing. When you open it it legit just has a page that says ""Nothing"" on it. It does nothing. St least it says it does nothing though.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
What a great app. It can do Nothing. The developer must be veey proud of his app. How it changes the life of people.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Hail 1 star to the developer to discourage overwhelming useless apps on playstore, lets war against the crappy apps to be taken down by Google.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
1min silence for them who are claiming that their life is changed... The app is actually nothing except wasting of time... Thanks for the negative comments saving my time,yes,Passive-Aggression,
stand front of wall & do nothing rather than downloading this app... If u don't want to do nothing..then what is the need of this app,yes,Passive-Aggression,
This app is lame as it's name... Kindly don't waste your time on Nothing because the reviews here are all schemed,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Are you kidding with me It's just a white photo with the word nothing and 
that's it. All thise who said it's a game are liars this is really nothing",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THESE LONG GOOD REVIEWS COME FROM. WHEN YOU OPEN APP, IT JUST SAYS THE WORD NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE OF A WHITE SCREEN. POINTLESS. LITERALLY THIS APP IS NOTHING. EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED",yes,Passive-Aggression,
TL;DR Go watch the YouTube video about this app. & save 30 min. of your life. The reviews are satirical. Don't bother to download this dumpster fire of an app.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Dear developers , Its an amazing idea . Realizing it that how important are other works rather than playing this game are. Thnx a lot bro. But relly awesome gameplay",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This is false advertisement i was expecting an app that did nothing,  but it infact does open up to a white screen that has the audacity to not even be blank! One star review",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Possibly the most interesting game I've ever played. Constantly making you think about how you managed to get to a point this low in life. I would pay actual money for this game. Keep up the good work Ã°ÂÂÂ,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Well... First.. The code is you slide from nothing, up ÃÂ2 down ÃÂ2 left once right once left again and right again. Then do B then A and you tap the triangle. You have to watch a TEN HOUR VIDEO in order to play a game.... Yeah..10 hours of regret. Why does it have to be ten hours... Why can't it be a lot shorter video? Other than that... Its ok.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Only one thing. The creater of this app should get nothing in life. Not even life.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Okay. Let's get serious. The ""up up down down left right left right B A Triangle"" thing worked, then it redirected me to a random 10-hour youtube video (Some of them are creepy). After all, it's not just nothing. It comes with nonesense too. I don't know but if only I could give 10 stars, I would. Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Uhm, are you serious? I was actually looking for a quality game. Not TEN HOURS of Nyan Cat music with some random clip at the end. It was a decent idea if this was meant to be a joke. Great job developers. Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I had this app in the past before, and noticed a lot of neat new features such as the new puzzle game. A lot to do in this game, but the Facebook integration is broken. I can't sync it to level up, as well as a ton of bugs. Are the developers lazy? They need to remove google games integration as it's not functional, and fix an issue where it stops clicking on the gold vault",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Fun time killer, but the developer needs to add more levels and more things to buy. I'm currently at 4.09BBB per second and level 95, the vault needs a higher capacity option more than KBB, there needs to be more financial and business options as well. Also add an easy upgrade option instead of having to tap each time for an upgrade, it takes a really really long time to upgrade everything after surrendering.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP TRYING TO CONNECT TO GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES! An ad pops up every thirty seconds and Everytime you level ANYTHING up. After the ad, it ALWAYS trys to connect to Google play services. I eventually said sure and set it up with my account. It still pops up! It still trys to get me click an account! If you spam click before it can load you can skip it but a lot of the time the visual for the money being thrown gets glitched and is just black squares. Thanks for nothing.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Make It Rain, like almost every other mobile game suffers from greedy developers adding an insufferable amount of ads after every small action you do in the game. It's almost as if I have downloaded an app that plays nothing but ads but has a game included. It is truly disgusting and insulting how many ads are in games like this nowadays and shows that they see consumers such as myself as nothing but a vessel to shove ads down our throats.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Ads. Swipe. More ads. Swipe. Few more ads. Swipe swipe. Addddddddsss. Best of luck spending more than 60 seconds without an ad.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"It doesn't even deserve 1 star. They seem to be more interested in showing ads than in a person winning the game. They won't let me get over the ""BBBB"" level. They also won't let me bet past the second level. I have been playing this game, off-and-on, for the past 7+ years, and STILL can't pass the ""BBBB"" level. I do NOT recommend this game to anyone. They slow me down in every way they can. They don't credit me with points that I've LEGITIMATELY won. This game is not fair to me AT ALL.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This game actually has a good base, multiple ways of earning money, it looks good and it plays well. However, I cannot get over the adds that keep popping up in your face, it's every 30 seconds or so, and they usually come up when you're tapping, meaning that you accidentally open the app store or open a web page. it's incessant, and it destroys the experience.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I like many other people here am coming back to the game to get some good ol' memories and uuuh... Im surprised... The game has much more ads than usual, there's so many pop-up icons that i can barely tap on the money... This game has definitely lowered its quality and standards in my opinion... Its still playable, but, man was the older version better. the pop-ups, ads every 2 min and my phone heating up to the level of ""i cant tuch this, its burning"" were a big deal breaker. All from me folks.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This game is fun... Until you start getting smacked in the face with unskippable ads you don't even expect ever 30-40 seconds. I find myself tapping the home arrow on my phone more than the game itself just so I can get back to playing quicker, only to have the same obnoxious ad slam me back in the face within 5 seconds. Uninstalling the game until the devs do something about it.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
1 . after taping for a while and then pulling up any tabs will cause the game to freak and can only be reversed if you press the back button or resetting the game. 2 . everything is very much squished together and can sometimes mess me up. 3 . It seems to look like it hasn't been updated since 2011. 4 . On the cash wheel if you want to continue the game force's you to buy golden pigs to continue making you spend RIL money.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"it doesnt have enough ads. i would like ads after every tap so i know just how much money you make :) you guys deserve all of the money in the world with just how little ads you display, one every few seconds isnt enough. more invasive ads, more wonderful pop ups, more distractions, more abstractions of currency!",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Ads. Every. Five. Seconds. Not to mention that the ""5 extra moves"" thing is a scam. To put it simply, if you have under 3 pigs(kind of like gems) it offers you 5 more moves on one of the games, but it costs you 3 pigs. If you don't have enough, you're forced to lose the mini game, resulting in the loss of money. If you have 3 pigs, it bumps the price to 4. You have 4 pigs? Great! Now you need five. You can only really buy more moves if you have 12 pigs. It tries to coerce you into spending real money on pigs to win the mini game. Other than the ads(which are super hard to close btw), the scams, and the annoyance of not being able to gain money when you close the app (unless you upgrade your vault, which is pointless once you reach a certain point), the gameplay is fun. Ironically, it's really just trying to get you to spend actual money",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"You dont make Real Cash !!! More of a busniess game , where you have to buy things for your banks and unlock items and so on....it takes way to long and your reward is not good enough to make me keep playing...not worth playing at all. If there was a way to cash out for real cash or gift cards .. I would definitly keep playing.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Paid 18 golden pigs for 1 minute and the game literally stole it. Nothing happened. Will change my rating if and when I get my 18 golden pigs back.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"absolutely the wrost, i decided to buy a in app purchase of 99 cents and never received my items i then decided to contact the email linked in both the game and play store, never got a response. yes its just a dollar but its still not allowed to do that definitely worth less than 1 star.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Decent game. If it weren't for the constant pop-ups and being requested to watch ads it would have been a higher rating. Not to mention the purchase scamming.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Wasted a lot of time, met requirements to cash out and it would be followed by another requirement, then another and so on. I had like 200, 400, 600, never got a penny. Oh yeah and the ads, they just kept getting worse. Fortunately I went into this expecting nothing, so in that regard I wasn't disappointed.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Highly disruptive video ads that always appear as the player is tapping, making them accidentally tap on the ad. Features that require ""Golden Pigs"" often ask for too many ""Golden Pigs"" (i.e an ""Insane Cash Blast"" costs 380 Pigs even though the Cash you recieve could have been easily earned by tapping for thirty seconds.) Tournaments don't give rewards. ""Rain on photos"" does not work. App requests access to contacts, phone, and all personal files. Strange.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I love this game, I even spent some money for those pigs. But after playing for a while my next surrender is at 21.7 MBBB witch is insain!! with all my upgrade I get 27 KBBB that's more then 20000 taps for a small reward! I hope you fix this, and I'm hoping you are working on new areas of the ""bunker"" its saying ""comeing soon"" over a year now! Also let's not get started on the INPOSIBLE MINI GAMES. In my 1 year of playing I made it once!!! I spent 50 gold pigs because I was starting to lose it!",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"It's worst off than before, I've played this games a couple years back and it wasn't this bad with Google play to werr u can't connect your account or so many ads it make u wanna rage quit.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"The quests want me to buy stuff that doesn't exist anymore. I remember playing this about a year ago and these items were there, but it isn't there anymore. Speaking of which this game has gotten worse. I want to go back in updates to get the game to be good again.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
gonna say very amazing game but unfortunately the 2 star rating is due to the fact i upgrade or buy upgrades and a forceful video ad pops up is pathetic it doesnt happen if your internets turned off but that's to big of a inconvenience fix the ad pop upz during upgrading and I'll be happy to give a 5 star rating,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"They will give you an ad within 1 minute of opening the app. Ads are constant, and often (in my case) unskippable. Ridiculous. Goodbye, uninstalled forever.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Wish I had looked at the reviews before making an in app purchase. Spent $5.99 on golden pig pack, shows it went through on my bank account, but game came up with a message saying an error occured and I DIDN'T EVEN GET WHAT I PAID FOR. I WOULD LIKE A REFUND OR THE PRODUCT IN WHICH I PURCHASED.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
It is a good game for when you want to waste time and it is quite addicting I put it at three stars because when you level up it is ment to give you rewards but for me from level 9 it has stop given me my rewards,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Tip to users who don't want to grind for dinos: Click the insane cash blast, close the buy more pigs menu, and you'll get 100 free dinos. Repeat this until you've reached 1400 dinos and you'll have unlocked everything in the event in under half a minute.             Tip to the developers: Make sure your redesign doesn't suck",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"THEIF, I purchased the $1.99 for 25 pigs and the $2.99 starter pack both of which I was charged for and did not receive. It stated that the purchase failed and to try again later. I do have the receipts from Google play showing I was charged. If unfixed I will be reporting.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
I would play this before it got updated and it was awesome. Now you have buttons in your way and there's no chance of getting to the piggy bank or mattress so you are stuck on missions. What a horrible game!,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Paid for two in-game items and they haven't shown up at all. Uninstalled. I emailed for an update on this and I haven't heard a thing. Ads are also extremely intrusive,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"I might be crazy for expecting more from a free phone game, but it's just swiping. There's no point. The money serves no purpose other than to purchase upgrades that help you. . .get more money. It's like a parody of the pointlessness and stupidity of most mobile games except it isn't meant to be funny at all.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Fun game when you hand nothing else to do but has some issues. The ui is confusing on where to use Golden shovels where to change settings. It made the game super annoying,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It's a good have but I would've given it 5 stars but I didn't cause when you pay for something on this have the app scams you and says that the payment was successful but doesn't give you anything and still charges you. It's better to play this app without buying anything.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It fun but it's a dead game. I've unlocked everything there is to unlock and it say more is coming soon. Well it's been over 2 years and still nothing... I wish there was actually updates for this game.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This new donut update is messing up the app everytime i try to click something it freezes the entire app. Please fix, because i love this game and dont want to have to delete it. 2 stars for now because i cant do anything on the app.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Fun game but runs ads every 5 minutes breaking the flow. Played other Clicker games like this but never had my game interrupted with a mandatory ad before.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Way too many advertisements. The advertisements are also scams as they promote games where you ""win"" real money. The placements of the icons to purchase golden bills for example are bad. Thankd to that I ended up wasting almost all of my golden pigs.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Need to make the ads optional and way less annoying. Can't tap enough for an upgrade cause I get hit with so many ads.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
Too many ads. No option to get ad free. Uninstalling. It used to be a decent time killer until the developer got stingy.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"App is pretty garbage, ads every 30 seconds, i cant stress this enough, DONT buy ANYTHING from this game, it will show up in your transactions and wont give you anything.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"This game is not fun, I'd need real cash to spend my time on this game. Too tedious and very hard on your touch screen. So since there are no real world rewards it's not worth considering.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Yeah it was cool. Until I watched an ad to get x2 cash for 30 seconds and I lost all my progress had to start over. So thanks.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"All of the ads make it super annoying to play, I get people need to make money but you spend more time looking at ads than playing the game",yes,Passive-Aggression,
I read other people's feedback and downloaded this app only downloaded it because it a good feedback will my god what are scam these people that put that feedback their obviously developers friends because it is so boring and dumb you can just pick any other app it doesn't matter what it is and be more interesting watching wet paint dry would be more fun than playing in this boring arse casino wannabe want to be casino but it will never be thanks developer for wasting my download scum,yes,Passive-Aggression,
the overabundance of ads and in-app purchases makes my brain numb. it used to be so much better. but now it's garbage.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Less than 5 minutes of gameplay with wifi connection, 2 pop up ads interrupting my swiping. Do I need to say more?",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Purchased the starter pack but did not receive it. Emailed them but got ignored and no reply at all. Purchase at your own risk.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I have the same problem with this game. Spending money and not receiving any thing and I Emailed the company and no responses. Thinking about emailing Google And reporting this game as Fraud.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"What is the point to this ""game""? It's extremely boring . Also I really do not appreciate what was chosen to represent the levels.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
had 11KBBB and it reset the whole game. now I have nothing. not wasting any more of my time with this game,yes,Passive-Aggression,
It doesn't give you the option to cash out so your basically just so swiping for nothing . Definitely uninstalling,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I hate it. Its a game with no point or good expiriance. The only thing you can even do in this game is tap.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"baught 25 gold pigs, never recived them, game is slow laggy, have contacted devloper for refund, no responce as of yet, taking this up with papal to get goole invoved, uninstalled game due to suspicious behaviour.",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"Glitches ,and throw outs, when connections are made from my WiFi, so I'm giving it a one star I'm not happy or happy with the cheesy stuff that I am sure that everyone would agree with me",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"i bought a pack of golden pigs and it took my money and i got no pigs, tried to contact them and got nothing back. highly dont recommend way better games with more professinal creators",yes,Passive-Aggression,
Has unskippable ads would not recommend if u dont want to waste your time,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I give it a 2 star because I'd rather play the game not watch ads after upgrading anything,yes,Passive-Aggression,
"i've no idea how you've managed to make a game this annoying. it's almost like it's a satirical simplification of the status quo, 10/10",yes,Passive-Aggression,
"THIS GAME WAS WORKING FINE WHEN I GOT IT THE OTHER TIME BUT NOW IT KEEPS SAYING ""MAKE IT RAIN HAS STOPED"" IM NOT RATING THIS GAME... ITS LIKE THE GAME IS DOWN. THIS GAME DESERVES A 1 FOR NOW!... UNINSTALLED!",yes,Passive-Aggression,
lost my Progress and game made my phone laggy while button smashing thanks make it rain :(,yes,Passive-Aggression,
I made an in app purchase twice. You didn't give me what I paid for but yet took my money.,yes,Passive-Aggression,
